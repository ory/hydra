Keep in mind that this data will be available to anyone performing OAuth 2.0 Challenge Introspection. If only your services can perform OAuth 2.0 Challenge Introspection, this is usually fine. But if third parties can access that endpoint as well, sensitive data from the session might be exposed to them. Use with care!
