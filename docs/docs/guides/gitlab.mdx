title: Gitlab Hydra integration
---

Gitlab has several OAuth2 related features. The relevant here is the possibility
to sign into GitLab with (almost) any OAuth2 provider, in this case Ory Hydra.
So, in this guide, we'll connect GitLab's omniauth-connector to Ory Hydra. We'll
do that in a docker-based lab-environment in order to investigate the details
before you do something like this in production.

## Preparation

Even though we're mostly using Ory Hydra in a docker-container, having the
command-line-client available is quite useful. So please install Ory Hydra as
explained in the [installation-guide](../install). You'll also need
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

The [5-min-tutorial](../5min-tutorial) might be worth checking out upfront.
It'll a give a nice quick overview how OAuth2 is working within Ory Hydra with a
minimal example. We assume basic knowledge, here.

If you have not yet the source code of Ory Hydra, which we'll need for the
`docker-compose` yaml-files and the gitlab-configuration, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git
```

We will access GitLab via the url http://gitlab.example.com. So we need to map
it to localhost. This is done by modifying the hosts-file. On an unixoid system
find this file in `/etc/hosts`, on windows, you should find it in
`c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`. Add this line:

```
127.0.0.1 gitlab.example.com
```

As this POC will work with http instead of https, we need to whitelist the above
domain-name to allow unencrypted http traffic. So add the following switch to
the services.hydra.command-section in the quickstart.yml around line 24 so that
the line looks like this:

```
    serve all --dangerous-allow-insecure-redirect-urls http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/Ory_Hydra/callback
```

## Spin up the instances and logging in

Use this command to spinup the instances. This will show the logs on the
terminal and it will take some time.

```shell
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml \
    -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f ./contrib/quickstart/quickstart-gitlab.yml \
    up --build
```

After this succeeds, you can access the login page
[sign-in-page](http://localhost:8000/users/sign_in). Don't try to login, yet, we
have to create the client in Ory Hydra, first.

## Creating the client in Ory Hydra

Depending on whether you've the hydra-binary available, you can use it directly
or the one in the docker-container.

```shell
$ hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitlab \
    --secret theSecret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token, email \
    --scope openid,offline_access,profile,email \
    --callbacks http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/Ory_Hydra/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post
```

or you can use the binary within the docker-container:

```shell script
$ docker-compose -f quickstart.yml exec hydra \
    hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitlab \
    --secret theSecret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token,email \
    --scope openid,offline_access,profile,email \
    --callbacks http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/Ory_Hydra/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post
```

## OAuth2 Login

With the first access of your
[GitLab-instance](http://gitlab.example.com:8000/), you will have to change the
root-password. You should see a "Ory Hydra" Login-button. Clicking it will
forward you to the hydra-consent-app where you can login with foo@bar.com/foobar
similar to the 5-min-tutorial. After that you have to give consent to accessing
your email-address. Congratulations, doing that should redirect you directly to
your personal GitLab-page. You have logged into GitLab via Ory Hydra.

So now, let's look at the individual pieces and how all of them work together.

## Docker-setup

Gitlab has some [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/) about
how to use their docker-images. It has also an example for docker-compose. The
`quickstart-gitlab.yaml` file in the contrib directory doesn't contain
surprising things:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  gitlab:
    image: gitlab/gitlab-ce:13.0.6-ce.0
    restart: always
    hostname: gitlab.example.com
    environment:
      GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
        external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com:8000/'
    ports:
      - '8000:8000' # http
    volumes:
      - './contrib/quickstart/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab'
      - './contrib/quickstart/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab'
      - './contrib/quickstart/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab'
```

Other then `logs` and `data`, the config directory is already prepopulated and
the single most important configuration-file is the `gitlab.rb` file. GitLab has
a mechanism to override values and we use it here to specify the `external_url`.

So let's move on to `gitlab.rb`.

## GitLab configuration - OAuth2-setup

The gitLab-configuration in `contrib/quickstart/gitlab/config/gitlab.rb` is the
original "template" which consists of 2400 lines of comments on how to do stuff.
Our relevant configuration starts at line 432 where the corresponding comments
about OAuth2 is located as well. It looks like this:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['omniauth_enabled'] = true
gitlab_rails['omniauth_block_auto_created_users'] = false
gitlab_rails['omniauth_allow_single_sign_on'] = ['Ory_Hydra']
gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
  {
    'name' => 'oauth2_generic',
    'app_id' => 'gitlab',
    'app_secret' => 'theSecret',
    'args' => {
      client_options: {
        'site' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444', # including port if necessary
        'user_info_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/userinfo',
        'authorize_url' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/auth',
        'token_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/oauth2/token'
      },
      user_response_structure: {
        root_path: [],
        id_path: 'sub',
        attributes: {
                email: 'sub'
        }
      },
      authorize_params: {
        scope: 'email'
      },
      # optionally, you can add the following two lines to "white label" the display name
      # of this strategy (appears in urls and Gitlab login buttons)
      # If you do this, you must also replace oauth2_generic, everywhere it appears above, with the new name.
      name: 'Ory_Hydra', # display name for this strategy
      #strategy_class: "OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2Generic" # Devise-specific config option Gitlab uses to find renamed strategy
    }
  }
]
```

The documentation for this, other then inside the file, is a bit scattered:

- A specific
  [step-by-step guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth2_generic.html)
  but not very detailed
- [OmniAuth reference documentation in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/omniauth.html#initial-omniauth-configuration)
- [OmniAuth Generic reference documentation in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth2_generic.html)
- [OmniAuth Gem-documentation from Satorix](https://gitlab.com/satorix/omniauth-oauth2-generic#gitlab-config-example)

The biggest-source for errors is the clients-options-section. Here we'll specify
the details for the OAuth2 flow and where Ory Hydra is located. Two things are
extremely important to keep in your mind when looking at configurations which
are specifying some flow one way or another:

- Where is the DNS-name resolved? Sometimes it's on the users browser, sometimes
  on GitLab or on the hydra-side. Especially in our docker-based POC, it makes a
  huge difference!
- Cookies can only be written/read, if they are from the same domain. In that
  case "127.0.0.1". That would be a different domain than "localhost". Pay
  attention to that.

These two points in our mind, let's look at the three configurations:

- `'site' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444'` This is the default for the three URLs
  later if not specified otherwise.
- `'authorize_url' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/auth'` this url will be a
  redirect-target and therefore resolved on the browser of the user. Probably we
  could omit the scheme, host and port as this is already defined in `site`.
- `'token_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/oauth2/token'` the `token_url` will get
  used on the GitLab-server to get a token after GitLab received the grant. As
  it's resolved on the GitLab-side, we're using docker-name of the
  hydra-container which is by default resolvable on the GitLab-container.
- `'user_info_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/userinfo',` same thing for the
  `user_info_url`. It's called on the GitLab-container and needs to be
  resolvable there.

The paths here are by default the same paths which are specified by OpenID
connect. The configuration would be simpler if we would use OpenID-Connect (more
about that later in the appendix) but in our case we're simply manually
specifying the values. So it's not an accident that these pathes here are the
very same then what you get from Ory Hydra:

```shell script
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:4444/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .
[...]
{
  "issuer": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/",
  "authorization_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/auth",
  "token_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/token",
  "jwks_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/.well-known/jwks.json",
[...]
  "userinfo_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/userinfo",
  "scopes_supported": [
    "offline_access",
    "offline",
    "openid"
  ],
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": [
    "client_secret_post",
    "client_secret_basic",
    "private_key_jwt",
    "none"
  ],
  [...]
}
```

Also worth noting here is the supported `token_endpoint_auth_methods`: How does
GitLab authenticate against Ory Hydra? So GitLab is using `client_secret_post`
which we needed to specify when we've created the GitLab-client in Ory Hydra.

Some remarks for creating the client. We have created the client like this. The
second command shows the created client:

```shell
$ hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitlab \
    --secret theSecret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token, email \
    --scope openid,offline_access,profile,email \
    --callbacks http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/Ory_Hydra/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post

$ hydra clients get hydra --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445
{
        "client_id": "gitlab",
        "created_at": "2020-08-31T08:47:30.000Z",
        "grant_types": [
                "authorization_code",
                "refresh_token"
        ],
        "jwks": {},
        "metadata": {},
        "redirect_uris": [
                "http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/Ory_Hydra/callback"
        ],
        "response_types": [
                "code",
                "id_token",
                ""
        ],
        "scope": "openid offline_access profile email",
        "subject_type": "public",
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post",
        "updated_at": "2020-08-31T08:47:30.000Z",
        "userinfo_signed_response_alg": "none"
}
```

- The endpoint is not part of the configuration but it's a command-line-switch
  telling the hydra-binary to which hydra-instance to talk to
- `id` and `secret` has been specified before in the GitLab-config
- the token-endpoint-auth-method is by default `client_secret_basic` but GitLab
  is using `client_secret_post` (couldn't find that anywhere in the
  GitLab-documentation, though)
- The callback needs to be resolvable on the users-browser. However, originally,
  the callback-url is created on the GitLab-side. In order to make that
  resolvable on the client, we set the `external_url` in the
  GitLab-configuration. Here that value is just there to cross-check with the
  generated one. It needs to match exactly.

## Proper GitLab user-creation

Initially, GitLab doesn't have any user but it needs them in order to manage
authorisation, no matter how the login is done. This is a common issue and a
common solution to this is to create the users on the fly with the first login.
So in order to do that, these lines are enabling that:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['omniauth_block_auto_created_users'] = false
gitlab_rails['omniauth_allow_single_sign_on'] = ['Ory_Hydra']
```

In order to get the necessary data for the user, gitlab needs to call to hydra's
[userinfo-endpoint](../reference/api.mdx#openid-connect-userinfo). The most
important attribute is the sub-attribute which provides, according to the
[specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken),
the ID of a user which is (in this case) the email-address. However, the
email-address is also an attribute in the specification but in the
implementation of the of this one hardcoded user (foo@bar.com) is empty.

So therefore we're specifying a mapping telling gitlab it should take the
sub-field and use it as email:

```ruby
      user_response_structure: {
        root_path: [],
        id_path: 'sub',
        attributes: {
                email: 'sub'
        }
      },
```

Whether the attribute "email" is there or not is quite critical here. The
Login-ID has the form of an email. So in order to satisfy Gitlab's requirement,
we're mapping here the email-attribute to the Login-ID which is represented by
"sub". This shouldn't be necessary in a real-world-implementation.

But assuming that it's not doing that mapping, then GitLab would need to ask Ory
Hydra on that endpoint the email-address. But is GitLab even allowed to read it?
We need consent from the user for that and fortunately we configured the client
above to be able to ask for that scope. However, we also need to configure
GitLab to actually ask for that scope:

```
     authorize_params: {
           scope: 'email'
      },
```

## Conclusion

We've successfully integrated GitLab with Ory Hydra. Everything was done as
configuration. No code has been created nor has any application been
monkey-patched while following this guide (so far).

## Troubleshooting

### Client wrong

After trying to login you get a message like this:

> Error: invalid_client Description: Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown
> client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication
> method) Hint: The requested OAuth 2.0 Client does not exist.

Doublecheck your registered clients. Mae sure ID and password are correct and
matches that of the gitlab.rb:

```shell
$ hydra clients list --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445
| CLIENT ID | NAME | RESPONSE TYPES |             SCOPE              |                        REDIRECT URIS                         |           GRANT TYPES            | TOKEN ENDPOINT AUTH METHOD |
|-----------|------|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| gitlab    |      | code,id_token, | openid offline_access profile  | http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/Ory_Hydra/callback | authorization_code,refresh_token | client_secret_post         |
|           |      |                | email                          |                                                              |                                  |                            |
$
```

### From Hydra: request is missing ... or otherwise malformed

So after this, clicking the login-button on the
[sign-in-page](http://localhost:8000/users/sign_in) will forward to Ory Hydra,
which will redirect to the consent-app on port 3000. After the login, you'd get
to the granting-page of the consent-app and after you've "allowed access",
you'll get redirected back to gitlab which will unfortunately mention:

> Could not authenticate you from OryHydra because "The request is missing a
> required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter
> more than once, or is otherwise malformed".

So the message in quotes is from Ory Hydra and not very expressive. Note that
it's a bit difficult to expose very meaningful error-messages as this could be
used for security-attacks. So in such cases check the hydra-logs on what's
wrong.

### Ory Hydra Logs: Redirect URL is using an insecure protocol

```
hydra_1          | time=2020-08-24T12:42:36Z level=error msg=An error occurred

remote:172.19.0.1:47684 scheme:http] service_name= service_version=
```

The relevant part here is: `Redirect URL is using an insecure protocol`. Make
sure to add the --dangerous-force-http to the hydra-command as described above.

After that, restart the hydra-container like this:

```shell
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml \
    -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f quickstart-gitlab.yml \
    restart hydra
```

### GitLab: Signing in ... is not allowed

> Signing in using your Ory Hydra account without a pre-existing GitLab account
> is not allowed. Create a GitLab account first, and then connect it to your Ory
> Hydra account.

Double-Check the above explanation about user-creation.

### GitLab: Email can't be blank

> Sign-in failed because Email can't be blank and Notification email can't be
> blank.

Double-check the `user_response_structure` and the `authorize_params`. The
`attributes` need an email-entry.

## Appendix: Some notes about OpenID connect

GitLab is supporting OpenID-Connect and Ory Hydra does that as well. Why hasn't
that been used in this guide?

OpenID might be the better choice then plain OAuth2. When we tried that, we ran
into the issue that the used OpenID-connect-implementation does not allow
http-connection but "only" https. That's in general a good thing but stupid for
POCs like this. Whereas Ory Hydra has a switch to whitelist URLs in such cases,
the used
[openid-connect-implementation](https://github.com/nov/openid_connect/issues/47)
doesn't seem to have that. So, here is a reasonable openID-Connect
configuration:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
  { 'name' => 'openid_connect',
    'label' => 'Ory Hydra',
    # 'icon' => '<custom_provider_icon>',
    'args' => {
      'name' => 'openid_connect',
      'scope' => ['openid'],
      'response_type' => 'code',
      'issuer' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/',
      'discovery' => true,
      'client_auth_method' => 'basic',
      'send_scope_to_token_endpoint' => 'false',
      'client_options' => {
        'identifier' => 'gitlab',
        'secret' => 'theSecret',
        'redirect_uri' => 'http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/openid_connect/callback'
      }
    }
  }
]
```

In order to make that work which is not ssl, we need to patch the openid_connect
gem. Checkout the details
[here](https://github.com/nov/openid_connect/issues/47).

```shell
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml  -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f quickstart-gitlab.yml exec gitlab /opt/gitlab/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/openid_connect-1.1.8/lib/openid_connect/discovery/provider/config.rb
```

```
          def initialize(uri)
            @host = uri.host
            @port = uri.port unless [80, 443].include?(uri.port)
            @path = File.join uri.path, '.well-known/openid-configuration'
            @scheme = uri.scheme
            attr_missing!
          end

          def endpoint
            case scheme
            when "http"
              SWD.url_builder = URI::HTTP
            else
              SWD.url_builder = URI::HTTPS
            end
            SWD.url_builder.build [nil, host, port, path, nil, nil]
          rescue URI::Error => e
            raise SWD::Exception.new(e.message)
          end
```

In order to avoid that scenario, this guide avoids OpenID-Connect. There might
also be other [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/62208)
with OpenID-Connect on GitLab.
