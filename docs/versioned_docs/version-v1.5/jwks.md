A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that
represents a cryptographic key and is specified at
[IETF RFC7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517). If you've heard of PEM
files...

```
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
id: MIIFDjBABgkqhkiG9w0BBQ0wMzAbBgkqhkiG9w0BBQwwDg

-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
```

... JWKs are the same, but formatted using JSON:

```
{
  "keys":
  [
   {"kty":"oct",
    "alg":"A128KW",
    "k":"GawgguFyGrWKav7AX4VKUg"},

   {"kty":"oct",
    "k":"AyM1SysPpbyDfgZld3umj1qzKObwVMkoqQ-EstJQLr_T-1qS0gZH75
  aKtMN3Yj0iPS4hcgUuTwjAzZr1Z9CAow",
    "kid":"HMAC key used in JWS spec Appendix A.1 example"}
  ]
}
```

ORY Hydra offers an API for generating and managing JWKs, the
[JSON Web Keys API](https://www.ory.sh/docs/api/hydra). When using persistent
storage backends, the keys are encrypted at rest using AES256-GCM and _the
system secret_. The system secret is generated by default and overridden by the
environment variable `SECRETS_SYSTEM`.

JWKs are well supported amongst all languages. This endpoint helps you managing
certificates, private, public and symmetric keys. It is important to never
transport keys over insecure channels such as http.

The [REST API Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/api/hydra/) will give you
details on the various endpoints.

## Auto-generated JWKs

Hydra generates a couple of JSON Web Keys in order to operate correctly:

- `http://localhost:4445/keys/hydra.openid.id-token`: A RSA public/private key
  pair for signing and validating OpenID Connect ID Tokens.
- `http://localhost:4445/keys/https-tls`: A RSA public/private key pair and a
  certificate for signing HTTP over TLS.
