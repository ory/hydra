Spec-compliant OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is hard. Let's take a look how to
resolve certain issues.

## First Aid

There are three things you can do to quickly debug any issue:

1. Check the logs. ORY Hydra has extensive logging and you will find the issue
   most likely in the logs. Here is an example log line for a client that
   requested a redirect URL that did not match the whitelisted redirect URLS:
   `time="2018-08-07T16:01:16Z" level=error msg="An error occurred" description="The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed" error=invalid_request hint="The \"redirect_uri\" parameter does not match any of the OAuth 2.0 Client's pre-registered redirect urls."`
2. Check the URL because of two reasons:
   1. ORY Hydra sends `error_hint`, `error`, `error_description`, `error_debug`
      in the URL. You will find the cause of the error most likely in there.
   2. You are maybe in the wrong URL. Make sure the host and port and path is
      correct. This happens often, especially when you're just starting out and
      experimenting
3. Set environment variable `OAUTH2_EXPOSE_INTERNAL_ERRORS=true`. Do not do this
   in production, it is possible, though unlikely, that important data leaks
   with this. If set to true, ORY Hydra will set the `error_debug` query
   parameter if debug information is available.
4. If you're just starting out and experimenting your docker set up does not
   work at all:
   1. Stop all containers
   2. Remove them (unless you have something important running)
   3. Retry. **This can help a lot if you are new to this!**

## I am running into CSRF issues

We protect the Login and Consent flows using CSRF Cookies. This mitigates
several attack vectors but can lead cause issues when misconfigured. The most
common causes of CSRF issues are the following:

- You are mixing domains with IP addresses in your request - for example using
  `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` in the same flow.
- You are running ORY Hydra via HTTP but are missing the
  `--dangerous-force-http` CLI flag.
- You are running the OAuth2 flow in separate browsers, or in a browser with
  incognito mode. The Brave browser is also known for notoriously discarding
  cookies when used in "No-Tracking" mode.
- You are running ORY Hydra behind a Reverse Proxy (e.g. Load Balancer) that
  strips the Cookie header. If the reverse proxy supports path rewrites that
  might also cause issues!
- You are trying to do two OAuth2 flows at the same time in the same Browser.
- You have changed the Cookie SameSite behavior. If this is the default value
  (you did not change it), this should not be an issue.

:::warn You cannot call `/oauth2/auth` using an AJAX request. It is not allowed
and not possible with OAuth2. This endpoint can only be accessed using a normal
browser request. :::

## Logout is not working as expected

Sometimes, calling `/oauth2/sessions/logout` does not behave as expected, for
example:

- An error occurs.
- You are being redirected directly to the post_logout_redirect_uri instead of
  the logout UI.

First of all, there are two types of logout requests - one is called "OP (OpenID
Provider) Initiated" and one "RP (Relying Party) Initiated". The first flow MUST
NEITHER contain the `id_token_hint`, nor a `state`, nor
`post_logout_redirect_uri`.

If no active authentication session is set at ORY Hydra, the browser will be
redirected immediately to the system-wide configured post logout redirect URI.

An active session may be missing because:

- You are mixing up domain names (e.g. 127.0.0.1 and localhost - **this is a
  common mistake**)
- You are running ORY Hydra behind a proxy that messes with Cookies
- You are using a Browser with a very strict privacy policy which makes it
  difficult or impossible for ORY Hydra to properly set cookies. We've observed
  that the **Brave Browser** is very, very difficult here.
- You did not set `remember: true` when accepting the login request

**Before filing a bug report, make sure you actually have a cookie named
`oauth2_authentication_session` for the URL ORY Hydra is running on, and
especially for the domain that's in your `http://.../oauth2/sessions/logout`**

If `id_token_hint` is set, you may define both `state` and
`post_logout_redirect_uri`. The same problems can cause this flow to behave
unexpectedly as listed above, with the only difference that now ORY Hydra knows
who the user to be logged out is (from the `id_token_hint`) and if any
Front-/Back-channel Logout is configured for that client, it will be executed
even if there is no valid authentication session for that user in ORY Hydra.

## OpenID Connect ID Token missing

If you expect an OAuth 2.0 ID Token but are not receiving one, this can have
multiple reasons:

1. You are using the `client_credentials` grant which can not return an ID
   token.
2. You forgot to request the `openid` scope when calling
   `/oauth2/auth?response_type=code` (Authorize Code Flow - correct would be
   `/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=openid`) or the `id_token` response
   type when calling `/oauth2/auth?response_type=token` (Implicit/Hybrid flow -
   correct would be `/oauth2/auth?response_type=token+id_token&scope=openid` or
   any other combination such as `response_type=id_token`,
   `response_type=token+code+id_token`).
3. You consent app did not send `granted_scope: ["openid"]` or when accepting
   the consent request.
4. The OAuth 2.0 Client making the request is not allowed to request the scope
   `openid`.

## OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token is missing

If you expect an OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token but are not receiving one, this can
have multiple reasons:

1. You are using an implicit or hybrid flow. These flows never return a refresh
   token!
2. You are using the `client_credentials` grant which can not return a refresh
   token.
3. You forgot to request the `offline` or `offline_access` scope when calling
   `/oauth2/auth`.
4. You consent app did not send `granted_scope: ["offline"]` or
   `granted_scope: ["offline_access"]` when accepting the consent request.
5. The OAuth 2.0 Client making the request is not allowed to request the scope
   `openid`.

## OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow fails

The most likely cause is misconfiguration, summarized in the next sections.

### Wrong or misconfigured OAuth 2.0 Client

You are using the wrong OAuth 2.0 Client or the OAuth 2.0 Client has a broken
configuration. To check that you're using the right client, run:

```
hydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra <the-client-id>
```

The result shows you the whole client (excluding its secret). Check that the
values are correct. Example:

```
{
        "client_id": "my-client",
        "grant_types": [
                "authorization_code"
        ],
        "jwks": {},
        "redirect_uris": [
                "http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback"
        ],
        "response_types": [
                "code"
        ],
        "scope": "openid offline",
        "subject_type": "pairwise",
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
        "userinfo_signed_response_alg": "none"
}
```

### Redirect URL is not whitelisted

A likely cause of your request failing is that you are using the wrong redirect
URL. Assuming your OAuth 2.0 URL looks like
`http://ory-hydra/oauth2/auth?client_id=my-client&...&redirect_uri=http://my-url/callback`

The redirect URL `http://my-url/callback` must be whitelisted in your client
configuration. The URLs must match **exactly**. URL `http://my-url/callback` and
`http://my-url/callback?foo=bar` are different URLs!

To see the whitelisted redirect_uris, check the client:

```
hydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra <the-client-id>

{
        // ...
        "redirect_uris": [
                "http://127.0.0.1:5556/callback"
        ],
        // ...
}
```

Here you see that `http://my-url/callback` is not in the list, which is why the
request fails.

### OAuth 2.0 Client ID and secret are sent in body instead of header

There are multiple ways of authenticating OAuth 2.0 Clients at the
`/oauth2/token`:

- HTTP Basic Authorization (`client_secret_basic`) - the OAuth 2.0 Client ID and
  secret are sent in the HTTP Header (`Authorization: basic ....`)
- HTTP Body (`client_secret_post`) - the OAuth 2.0 Client ID and secret are sent
  in the POST body (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)

Both are valid schemes. But the OAuth 2.0 Client has to be configured to allow
either of the one. Per default, the OAuth 2.0 Client allows HTTP Basic
Authorization only. You can check which method is allowed:

```
hydra clients get --endpoint http://ory-hydra <the-client-id>
{
        // ...
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
        // ...
}
```

As you can see, this client is allowed to authorize using HTTP Basic
Authorization. If you try to authorize with the client credentials in the POST
body, the authentication process will fail. To allow a client to perform the
POST authorization scheme, you must set
`"token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post"`. You can do this in the CLI
with the `--token-endpoint-auth-method` flag.

## Distributed Tracing

### What is this?

Configuring Distributed Tracing (DT) will enable you to obtain a visualization
of the call paths that take place in order to process a request made to Hydra.
It's yet another tool that you can use to aid you in profiling, debugging and
ultimately understanding your deployment of Hydra better. Hydra currently
supports the following tracing options:

- Tracing backend(s): Jaeger - _Note: adding support for other
  [opentracing compliant backends](https://opentracing.io/docs/supported-tracers)
  is planned. To aid in priority, please
  [create an issue](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues) with your feature
  request._
- Following existing traces: If you have deployed Hydra behind a proxy that has
  initiated a trace, Hydra will attempt to join that trace by examining the
  request headers for tracing context.

### What a Hydra trace includes

In DT speak, a trace is comprised of one or more spans which are logical units
of work. Each Hydra span is encapsulated with the following state:

- A name
- A start time
- A finish time
- A set of zero or more tags

Hydra currently creates the following spans:

- Top level span (_named after the request path_) for the requested endpoint.
  Span tags: - http method - http status code - error IFF status code >= 400
- Child span will be created if bcrypt (_e.g. when the token endpoint is
  called_) is called. Span tags: - bcrypt work factor
- All SQL database interactions. Spans/tags will vary depending on the database
  driver used.

This is still evolving and subject to change as tracing support continues to
expand in Hydra. If you see something that is missing/wrong, please create an
issue.

### Alright, how can I set this up locally?

The
[provided docker-compose file](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/quickstart-tracing.yml)
in the project repository has tracing configuration w/ jaeger added which you
can use to play around with. Simply uncomment the configurations associated with
tracing as so:

**Under the Hydra service definition `depends_on` configs, uncomment the
following:**

```
- jaeger
```

**Under the Hydra service definition `environment` configs, uncomment the
following:**

```
- TRACING_PROVIDER
- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_SAMPLING_SERVER_URL
- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_LOCAL_AGENT_ADDRESS
- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_SAMPLING_TYPE
- TRACING_PROVIDER_JAEGER_SAMPLING_VALUE
```

**Uncomment the Jaeger service definition:**

```
jaeger:
  image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.7.0
  ports:
  - "5775:5775/udp"
  - "6831:6831/udp"
  - "6832:6832/udp"
  - "5778:5778"
  - "16686:16686"
  - "14268:14268"
  - "9411:9411"
```

Then simply run `docker-compose up`. Grab a coffee or stretch while you wait for
everything to come up. You will then be able to navigate to the Jaeger UI which
you have exposed on port `16686` at http://localhost:16686/search. You can now
start making requests to Hydra and inspect traces!

As an example, here is a trace created by making a bad request to the
`POST /clients` endpoint:

<img
  alt="Sample Trace"
  src={useBaseUrl('/images/docs/hydra/sample_trace.png')}
/>
;

At a glance, you are able to see that:

- The request failed
- The request took ~80ms
- It resulted in a 409
- The hash comparison to validate the client's credentials took a whopping 70ms.
  Bcrypt is expensive!
- The various database operations performed

_Note: in order to see spans around database interactions, you must be using a
SQL backend (i.e. MySQL or Postgres)._

### Tracing configurations

The CLI will provide you with the list of Hydra tracing configurations and their
supported values. Simply run:

```
docker exec -it hydra_hydra_1 hydra serve --help
```

And read the section on `DEBUG CONTROLS`.
