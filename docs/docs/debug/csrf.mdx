Because ORY Hydra is not just an API, but instead talks to your users' browsers
directly, several security measures have been implemented in ORY Kratos. One of
them is protection against CSRF:

> CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request.
> It inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired
> function on the victim’s behalf. For most sites, browser requests
> automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as the
> user’s session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and so forth.
> Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated to the site, the site will
> have no way to distinguish between the forged request sent by the victim and a
> legitimate request sent by the victim.

## Common Pitfalls

Sometimes, cookies and CSRF just wont work - all requests end up with a 401
Unauthorized or 400 Bad Request. Here are some common causes and easy fixes if
that happens to you!

Before starting to debug cookie and CSRF issues, make sure to check out the
Chrome Developer Tools (or any comparable technology) Cookies tabs in the
Application tab

src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/csrf_app_tab.png')} />

as well as the network tab - look for `Cookie` and `Set-Cookie` HTTP Headers:

### ORY Hydra Running Over HTTP Without dev-mode Enabled

You are running ORY Hydra via HTTP but are missing the `--dangerous-force-http` CLI flag:

```
$ hydra serve all -c path/to/config.yml --dangerous-force-http
```

### Mixing up `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`

Use either `127.0.0.1` (and in general IPs) or `localhost` (and in general hostnames)
consistently throughout your flow because cookies from an IP are not available to the
hostname and vice-versa.

### Reverse Proxy / Load Balancers

You are running ORY Hydra behind a Reverse Proxy (e.g. Load Balancer) that
strips the Cookie header. If the reverse proxy supports path rewrites that
might also cause issues!

### Running Flows in Separate Browsers or Browser Windows

You are running the OAuth2 flow in separate browsers, or in a browser with
incognito mode. The Brave browser is also known for notoriously discarding
cookies when used in "No-Tracking" mode.

### Running Multiple OAuth2 Flows Simultaneously

You are trying to do two OAuth2 flows at the same time in the same Browser.

### Cookie Same-Site Mode

You have changed the Cookie SameSite behavior. If this is the default value
(you did not change it), this should not be an issue.

### Using AJAX to call `/oauth2/auth`

You **cannot** call `/oauth2/auth` using an AJAX request. It is not allowed and
not possible with OAuth2. This endpoint can only be accessed using a normal
browser request by clicking a link or redirecting the end-user's browser
to that endpoint.
