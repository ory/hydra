The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to a fully functional set up that
includes ORY Hydra as well as our User Login & Consent Provider reference
implementation.

The goal of this section is to familiarize you with the specifics of setting up
ORY Hydra in your environment. Before starting with this section, please check
out the [tutorial](5min-tutorial). It will teach you the most important
flows and settings for Hydra.

This guide will:

1. Download and run a PostgreSQL container in Docker.
2. Download and run ORY Hydra in Docker.
3. Download and run our reference User Login & Consent Provider.
4. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client to perform the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow.
5. Perform the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code flow.

Before starting with this guide, please install the most recent version of
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download). While docker is
not required for running ORY Hydra, we recommend using it for this tutorial as
it will greatly reduce the complexity of setting up a database on your system
without virtualization, installing Go, and compiling ORY Hydra.

## Create a Network

Before we can start, a network must be created which we will attach all our
Docker containers to. That way, the containers can talk to one another.

```shell
$ docker network create hydraguide
```

## Deploy PostgreSQL

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use PostgreSQL as a database. As you
probably already know, don't run databases in Docker in production! For the sake
of this tutorial however, let's use Docker to quickly deploy the database.

```shell
$ docker run \
  --network hydraguide \
  --name ory-hydra-example--postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=hydra \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=hydra \
  -d postgres:9.6
```

This command wil start a postgres instance with name
`ory-hydra-example--postgres`, set up a database called `hydra` and create a
user `hydra` with password `secret`.

## Deploy ORY Hydra

We highly recommend using Docker to run Hydra, as installing, configuring and
running Hydra is easiest with Docker. ORY Hydra is available on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/hydra/).

```shell
# The system secret can only be set against a fresh database. Key rotation is currently not supported. This
# secret is used to encrypt the database and needs to be set to the same value every time the process (re-)starts.
# You can use /dev/urandom to generate a secret. But make sure that the secret must be the same anytime you define it.
# You could, for example, store the value somewhere.
$ export SECRETS_SYSTEM=$(export LC_CTYPE=C; cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1)
#
# Alternatively you can obviously just set a secret:
# $ export SECRETS_SYSTEM=this_needs_to_be_the_same_always_and_also_very_$3cuR3-._

# The database url points us at the postgres instance. This could also be an ephermal in-memory database (`export DSN=memory`)
# or a MySQL URI.
$ export DSN=postgres://hydra:secret@ory-hydra-example--postgres:5432/hydra?sslmode=disable

# Before starting, let's pull the latest ORY Hydra tag from docker.
$ docker pull oryd/hydra:v1.5.2

# This command will show you all the environment variables that you can set. Read this carefully.
# It is the equivalent to `hydra help serve`.
$ docker run -it --rm --entrypoint hydra oryd/hydra:v1.5.2 help serve

Starts all HTTP/2 APIs and connects to a database backend.
[...]

# ORY Hydra does not do magic, it requires conscious decisions, for example running SQL migrations which is required
# when installing a new version of ORY Hydra, or upgrading an existing installation.
# It is the equivalent to `hydra migrate sql --yes postgres://hydra:secret@ory-hydra-example--postgres:5432/hydra?sslmode=disable`
$ docker run -it --rm \
  --network hydraguide \
  oryd/hydra:v1.5.2 \
  migrate sql --yes $DSN

Applying `client` SQL migrations...
[...]
Migration successful!

# Let's run the server (settings explained below):
$ docker run -d \
  --name ory-hydra-example--hydra \
  --network hydraguide \
  -p 9000:4444 \
  -p 9001:4445 \
  -e SECRETS_SYSTEM=$SECRETS_SYSTEM \
  -e DSN=$DSN \
  -e URLS_SELF_ISSUER=https://localhost:9000/ \
  -e URLS_CONSENT=http://localhost:9020/consent \
  -e URLS_LOGIN=http://localhost:9020/login \
  oryd/hydra:v1.5.2 serve all

# And check if it's running:
$ docker logs ory-hydra-example--hydra

time="2017-06-29T21:26:26Z" level=info msg="Connecting with postgres://*:*@postgres:5432/hydra?sslmode=disable"
time="2017-06-29T21:26:26Z" level=info msg="Connected to SQL!"
[...]
time="2017-06-29T21:26:34Z" level=info msg="Setting up http server on :4444"
```

Let's dive into the various settings:

- `--network hydraguide` connects this instance to the network and makes it
  possible to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
- `-p 9000:4444` exposes ORY Hydra's public API on `https://localhost:9000/`.
- `-p 9001:4445` exposes ORY Hydra's administrative API on
  `https://localhost:9001/`.
- `-e SECRETS_SYSTEM=$SECRETS_SYSTEM` sets the system secret environment
  variable **(required)**.
- `-e DSN=$DSN` sets the database url environment variable **(required)**.
- `-e URLS_SELF_ISSUER=https://localhost:9000/` this value must be set to the
  publicly available URL of ORY Hydra **(required)**.
- `-e URLS_CONSENT=http://localhost:9020/consent` this sets the URL of the
  consent provider **(required)**. We will set up the service that handles
  requests at that URL in the next sections.
- `-e URLS_LOGIN=http://localhost:9020/login` this sets the URL of the login
  provider **(required)**. We will set up the service that handles requests at
  that URL in the next sections.

Note: In this example we did not define a value for the optional setting
`OAUTH2_ERROR_URL`. This URL can be used to provide an endpoint which will
receive error messages from ORY Hydra that should be displayed to the end user.
The URL receives `error` and `error_description` parameters. If this value is
not set, Hydra uses the fallback endpoint `/oauth2/fallbacks/error` and displays
a default error message. In order to obtain a uniform UI, you might want to
include such an endpoint in your login or consent provider.

To confirm that the instance is running properly,
[open the health check](https://localhost:9001/health/ready). If asked, accept
the self signed certificate in your browser. You should simply see `ok`.

On start up, ORY Hydra is initializing some values. Let's take a look at the
logs:

```shell
$ docker logs ory-hydra-example--hydra
time="2017-06-30T09:06:34Z" level=info msg="Connecting with postgres://*:*@postgres:5432/hydra?sslmode=disable"
time="2017-06-30T09:06:34Z" level=info msg="Connected to SQL!"
time="2017-06-30T09:06:34Z" level=info msg="Key pair for signing hydra.openid.id-token is missing. Creating new one."
time="2017-06-30T09:06:41Z" level=warning msg="No TLS Key / Certificate for HTTPS found. Generating self-signed certificate."
time="2017-06-30T09:06:41Z" level=info msg="Setting up http server on :4444"
```

As you can see, the following steps are performed when running ORY Hydra against
a fresh database:

1. If no system secret was given (in our case we provided one), a random one is
   generated and emitted to the logs. Note this down, otherwise you won't be
   able to restart Hydra.
2. Cryptographic keys are generated for the OpenID Connect ID Token, the consent
   challenge and response, and TLS encryption using a self-signed certificate,
   which is why we need to run all commands using `--skip-tls-verify`.

ORY Hydra can be managed using the Hydra Command Line Interface (CLI), which is
using ORY Hydra's REST APIs. To see the available commands, run:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it --entrypoint hydra oryd/hydra:v1.5.2 help
Hydra is a cloud native high throughput OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider

Usage:
  hydra [command]

[...]
```

## Deploy Login & Consent App

The Login Provider and Consent Provider can be two separate web services. We
provide a
[reference implementation](https://github.com/ory/hydra-login-consent-node)
which combines both features in one app. Here, we will use deploy that app using
Docker.

```shell
$ docker pull oryd/hydra-login-consent-node:v1.3.2
$ docker run -d \
  --name ory-hydra-example--consent \
  -p 9020:3000 \
  --network hydraguide \
  -e HYDRA_ADMIN_URL=https://ory-hydra-example--hydra:4445 \
  -e NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 \
  oryd/hydra-login-consent-node:v1.3.2

# Let's check if it's running ok:
$ docker logs ory-hydra-example--consent
```

Let's take a look at the arguments:

- `-p 9020:3000` exposes this service at port 9020. If you remember, that's the
  port of the `URLS_CONSENT` and `URLS_LOGIN` value from the ORY Hydra docker
  container (`URLS_CONSENT=http://localhost:9020/consent`,
  `URLS_LOGIN=http://localhost:9020/login`).
- `HYDRA_ADMIN_URL=http://hydra:4445` point to the ORY Hydra Administrative API.
- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` disables TLS verification, because we are
  using self-signed certificates.

## Perform OAuth 2.0 Flow

Great! Our infrastructure is all set up! Next it's time to perform the OAuth 2.0
Authorize Code flow. For that purpose, the ORY Hydra CLI has a feature that sets
up an OAuth 2.0 Consumer and an OAuth 2.0 callback URL. Typically, this would be
a third-party application that requests access to a user's resources on your
servers - for example a Facebook App you wrote that backs up a user's photos and
thus requires read access to the user's photos.

Before we go ahead, the OAuth 2.0 Client that performs the request has to be set
up. Let's call the client `facebook-photo-backup`. We have to specify which
OAuth 2.0 Grant Types, OAuth 2.0 Scope, OAuth 2.0 Response Types, and Callback
URLs the client may request:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it \
  -e HYDRA_ADMIN_URL=https://ory-hydra-example--hydra:4445 \
  --network hydraguide \
  oryd/hydra:v1.5.2 \
  clients create --skip-tls-verify \
    --id facebook-photo-backup \
    --secret some-secret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token,client_credentials,implicit \
    --response-types token,code,id_token \
    --scope openid,offline,photos.read \
    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:9010/callback

Client facebook-photo-backup
Client Secret: some-secret
```

Let's dive into some of the arguments:

- `--skip-tls-verify` is supported by all management commands
  (create/delete/update/... OAuth 2.0 Client, JSON Web Key, ...) and tells the
  CLI to trust any certificate authority - even self-signed ones. We need this
  flag because the server uses a self-signed certificate. In production
  deployments, you would use a certificate signed by a trusted CA.
- `--grant-types authorize_code,refresh_token,client_credentials,implicit` we
  want to be able to perform all of these OAuth 2.0 flows.
- `--response-types token,code,id_token` allows us to receive authorize codes,
  access and refresh tokens, and OpenID Connect ID Tokens.
- `--scope openid,offline,photos.read` allows the client to request various
  permissions:
  - `openid` allows the client to perform the OpenID Connect flow and request an
    OpenID Connect ID Token.
  - `offline` allows the client to request a refresh token. Because we want to
    continuously backup photos, the app must be able to refresh expired access
    tokens. This scope allows that.
  - `photos.read` this is an imaginary scope that is not handled by ORY Hydra
    but serves the purpose of making it clear that we could request read access
    to a user's photos. You can obviously omit this scope or use your own scope.
- `--callbacks http://localhost:9010/callback` allows the client to request this
  redirect uri.

Perfect, let's perform an exemplary OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code Flow! To make this
easy, the ORY Hydra CLI provides a helper command called `hydra token user`.
Just imagine this being, for example, passport.js that is generating an auth
code url, redirecting the browser to it, and then exchanging the authorize code
for an access token. The same thing happens with this command:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it \
  --network hydraguide \
  -p 9010:9010 \
  oryd/hydra:v1.5.2 \
  token user --skip-tls-verify \
    --port 9010 \
    --auth-url https://localhost:9000/oauth2/auth \
    --token-url https://ory-hydra-example--hydra:4444/oauth2/token \
    --client-id facebook-photo-backup \
    --client-secret some-secret \
    --scope openid,offline,photos.read

Setting up callback listener on http://localhost:9010/callback
Press ctrl + c on Linux / Windows or cmd + c on OSX to end the process.
If your browser does not open automatically, navigate to:

        https://localhost:9010/
```

open the link, as prompted, in your browser, and follow the steps shown there.
You might encounter a screen like the following one:

<img
  alt="Insecure connection"
  src={useBaseUrl('/images/docs/hydra/insecure-connection.png')}
/>
;

This happens because we run ORY Hydra with a self-signed TLS certificate. In
production deployments, you would probably use a certificate signed by a trusted
CA and not see this screen.

When you see this screen, click on "Advanced" and "Add Exception" to continue.
In some browsers, this might work differently, but it's always possible to
proceed.

When completed, you should land at a screen that looks like this one:

<img
  alt="OAuth 2.0 result"
  src={useBaseUrl('/images/docs/hydra/install-result.png')}
/>
;
