# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## v3.0.1 - 2016-01-30

### Fixed

 - Fixed import paths
 - Updated Go version used by Travis

## v3.0.0 - 2016-12-06

Unfortunately this will likely be the last release I plan to work on. This is due to the following reasons:

 - Over the last few years while I have spent a lot of time maintaining this driver I have not used it very much for my own personal projects.
 - My job has been keeping me very busy lately and I don't have as much time to work on this project as I used to.
 - The company behind RethinkDB has shut down and while I am sure the community will keep the database going it seems like a good time for me to step away from the project.
 - The driver itself is in a relatively good condition and many companies are using the existing version in production.

I hope you understand my decision to step back from the project, if you have any questions or would be interested in take over some of the maintenance of the project please let me know. To make this process easier I have also decided to move the repository to the GoRethink organisation. All existing imports _should_ still work.

Thanks to everybody who got involved with this project over the last ~4 years and helped out, I have truly enjoyed the time I have spent building this library and I hope both RethinkDB and this driver manage to keep going.

## v2.1.3 - 2016-08-01

### Changed

 - Changed behaviour of function callbacks to allow arguments to be either of type `r.Term` or `interface {}` instead of only `r.Term`

### Fixed

 - Fixed incorrectly named `Replicas` field in `TableCreateOpts`
 - Fixed broken optional argument `FinalEmit` in `FoldOpts`
 - Fixed bug causing some queries using `r.Row` to fail with the error `Cannot use r.row in nested queries.`

## v2.1.2 - 2016-07-22

### Added

 - Added the `InitialCap` field to `ConnectOpts` to replace `MaxIdle` as the name no longer made sense.

### Changed

 - Improved documentation of ConnectOpts
 - Default value for `KeepAlivePeriod` changed from `0` to `30s`

### Deprecated

 - Deprecated the field `MaxIdle` in `ConnectOpts`, it has now been replaced by `InitialCap` which has the same behaviour as before. Setting both fields will still work until the field is removed in a future version.

### Fixed

 - Fixed issue causing changefeeds to hang if no data was received

## v2.1.1 - 2016-07-12

 - Added `session.Database()` which returns the current default database

### Changed
 - Added more documentation

### Fixed
 - Fixed `Random()` not being implemented correctly and added tests (Thanks to @bakape for the PR)

## v2.1.0 - 2016-06-26

### Added

 - Added ability to mock queries based on the library github.com/stretchr/testify
     + Added the `QueryExecutor` interface and changed query runner methods (`Run`/`Exec`) to accept this type instead of `*Session`, `Session` will still be accepted as it implements the `QueryExecutor` interface.
     + Added the `NewMock` function to create a mock query executor
     + Queries can be mocked using `On` and `Return`, `Mock` also contains functions for asserting that the required mocked queries were executed.
     + For more information about how to mock queries see the readme and tests in `mock_test.go`.

## Changed

- Exported the `Build()` function on `Query` and `Term`.
- Updated import of `github.com/cenkalti/backoff` to `github.com/cenk/backoff`

## v2.0.4 - 2016-05-22

### Changed
 - Changed `Connect` to return the reason for connections failing (instead of just "no connections were made when creating the session")
 - Changed how queries are retried internally, previously when a query failed due to an issue with the connection a new connection was picked from the connection pool and the query was retried, now the driver will attempt to retry the query with a new host (and connection). This should make applications connecting to a multi-node cluster more reliable.

### Fixed
 - Fixed queries not being retried when using `Query()`, queries are now retried if the request failed due to a bad connection.
 - Fixed `Cursor` methods panicking if using a nil cursor, please note that you should still always check if your queries return an error.

## v2.0.3 - 2016-05-12

### Added
 - Added constants for system database and table names.

### Changed
 - Re-enabled keep alive by default.

## v2.0.2 - 2016-04-18

### Fixed
 - Fixed issue which prevented anonymous `time.Time` values from being encoded when used in a struct.
 - Fixed panic when attempting to run a query with a nil session

## v2.0.1 - 2016-04-14

### Added
 - Added `UnionWithOpts` term which allows `Union` to be called with optional arguments (such as `Interleave`)
 - Added `IncludeOffsets` and `IncludeTypes` optional arguments to `ChangesOpts`
 - Added `Conflict` optional argument to `InsertOpts`

### Fixed
 - Fixed error when connecting to database as non-admin user, please note that `DiscoverHosts` will not work with user authentication at this time due to the fact that RethinkDB restricts access to the required system tables.

## v2.0.0 - 2016-04-13

### Changed

 - GoRethink now uses the v1.0 RethinkDB protocol which supports RethinkDB v2.3 and above. If you are using RethinkDB 2.2 or older please set `HandshakeVersion` when creating a session. For example:
```go
r.Connect(
    ...
    HandshakeVersion: r.HandshakeV0_4,
    ...
)
```

### Added
 - Added support for username/password authentication. To login pass your username and password when creating a session using the `Username` and `Password` fields in the `ConnectOpts`.
 - Added the `Grant` term
 - Added the `Ordered` optional argument to `EqJoin`
 - Added the `Fold` term and examples
 - Added the `ReadOne` and `ReadAll` helper functions for quickly executing a query and scanning the result into a variable. For examples see the godocs.
 - Added the `Peek` and `Skip` functions to the `Cursor`.
 - Added support for referential arrays in structs
 - Added the `Durability` argument to `RunOpts`/`ExecOpts`

### Deprecated
 - Deprecated the root `Wait` term, `r.Table(...).Wait()` should now be used instead.
 - Deprecated session authentication using `AuthKey` 

### Fixed
 - Fixed issue with `ReconfigureOpts` field `PrimaryTag`

## v1.4.1 - 2016-04-02

### Fixed

 - Fixed panic when closing a connection at the same time as using a changefeed.
 - Update imports to correctly use gopkg.in
 - Fixed race condition when using anonymous functions
 - Fixed IsConflictErr and IsTypeErr panicking when passed nil errors
 - RunWrite no longer misformats errors with formatting directives in them

## v1.4.0 - 2016-03-15

### Added
- Added the ability to reference subdocuments when inserting new documents, for more information see the documentation in the readme.
- Added the `SetTags` function which allows GoRethink to override which tags are used when working with structs. For example to support the `json` add the following call `SetTags("gorethink", "json")`.
- Added helper functions for checking the error type of a write query, this is useful when calling `RunWrite`.
    + Added `IsConflictErr` which returns true when RethinkDB returns a duplicate key error.
    + Added `IsTypeErr` which returns true when RethinkDB returns an unexpected type error.
- Added the `RawQuery` term which can be used to execute a raw JSON query, for more information about this query see the godoc.
- Added the `NextResponse` function to `Cursor` which will return the next raw JSON response in the result set.
- Added ability to set the keep alive period by setting the `KeepAlivePeriod` field in `ConnectOpts`.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue that could prevent bad connections from being removed from the connection pool.
- Fixed certain connection errors not being returned as `RqlConnectionError` when calling `Run`, `Exec` or `RunWrite`. 
- Fixed potential dead lock in connection code caused when building the query.

## v1.3.2 - 2015-02-01

### Fixed
- Fixed race condition in cursor which caused issues when closing a cursor that is in the process of fetching data.

## v1.3.1 - 2015-01-22

### Added
 - Added more documentation and examples for `GetAll`.

### Fixed
- Fixed `RunWrite` not defering its call to `Cursor.Close()`. This could cause issues if an error occurred when decoding the result.
- Fixed panic when calling `Error()` on a GoRethink `rqlError`.

## v1.3.0 - 2016-01-11

### Added
 - Added new error types, the following error types can now be returned: `RQLClientError`, `RQLCompileError`, `RQLDriverCompileError`, `RQLServerCompileError`, `RQLAuthError`, `RQLRuntimeError`, `RQLQueryLogicError`, `RQLNonExistenceError`, `RQLResourceLimitError`, `RQLUserError`, `RQLInternalError`, `RQLTimeoutError`, `RQLAvailabilityError`, `RQLOpFailedError`, `RQLOpIndeterminateError`, `RQLDriverError`, `RQLConnectionError`. Please note that some other errors can be returned.
 - Added `IsConnected` function to `Session`.
 
### Fixed
 - Fixed panic when scanning through results caused by incorrect queue implementation.

## v1.2.0 - 2015-11-19
### Added
 - Added `UUID` term
 - Added `Values` term
 - Added `IncludeInitial` and `ChangefeedQueueSize` to `ChangesOpts`
 - Added `UseJSONNumber` to `ConnectOpts` which changes the way the JSON unmarshal works when deserializing JSON with interface{}, it's preferred to use json.Number instead float64 as it preserves the original precision.
 - Added `HostDecayDuration` to `ConnectOpts` to configure how hosts are selected. For more information see the godoc.

### Changed
 - Timezones from `time.Time` are now stored in the database, before all times were stored as UTC. To convert a go `time.Time` back to UTC you can call  `t.In(time.UTC)`.
 - Improved host selection to use `hailocab/go-hostpool` to select nodes based on recent responses and timings.
 - Changed connection pool to use `fatih/pool` instead of a custom connection pool, this has caused some internal API changes and the behaviour of `MaxIdle` and `MaxOpen` has slightly changed. This change was made mostly to make driver maintenance easier.
     + `MaxIdle` now configures the initial size of the pool, the name of this field will likely change in the future.
     + Not setting `MaxOpen` no longer creates an unbounded connection pool per host but instead creates a pool with a maximum capacity of 2 per host.

### Deprecated
 - Deprecated the option `NodeRefreshInterval` in `ConnectOpts`
 - Deprecated `SetMaxIdleConns` and `SetMaxOpenConns`, these options should now only be set when creating the session.

### Fixed
 - Fixed some type aliases not being correctly encoded when using `Expr`.

## v1.1.4 - 2015-10-02
### Added
 - Added root table terms (`r.TableCreate`, `r.TableList` and `r.TableDrop`)

### Removed
 - Removed `ReadMode` option from `RunOpts` and `ExecOpts` (incorrectly added in v1.1.0)

### Fixed 
 - Fixed `Decode` no longer setting pointer to nil on document not found
 - Fixed panic when `fetchMore` returns an error
 - Fixed deadlock when closing changefeed
 - Fixed stop query incorrectly waiting for response
 - Fixed pointers not to be properly decoded

## v1.1.3 - 2015-09-06

## v0.7.0 - 2015-03-30

This release includes support for RethinkDB 2.0 and connecting to clusters. To connect to a cluster you should use the new `Addresses` field in `ConnectOpts`, for example:

```go
session, err := r.Connect(r.ConnectOpts{
    Addresses: []string{"localhost:28015", "localhost:28016"},
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err.Error())
}
```

Also added was the ability to read from a cursor using a channel, this is especially useful when using changefeeds. For more information see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/gorethink/2865686d163ed78bbc3c)

```go
cursor, err := r.Table("items").Changes()
ch := make(chan map[string]interface{})
cursor.Listen(ch)
```

For more details checkout the [README](https://github.com/gorethink/gorethink/blob/master/README.md) and [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorethink/gorethink). As always if you have any further questions send me a message on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/gorethink/gorethink).

- Added the ability to connect to multiple nodes, queries are then distributed between these nodes. If a node stops responding then queries stop being sent to this node.
- Added the `DiscoverHosts` optional argument to `ConnectOpts`, when this value is `true` the driver will listen for new nodes added to the cluster.
- Added the `Addresses` optional argument to `ConnectOpts`, this allows the driver to connect to multiple nodes in a cluster.
- Added the `IncludeStates` optional argument to `Changes`.
- Added `MinVal` and `MaxVal` which represent the smallest and largest possible values.
- Added the `Listen` cursor helper function which publishes database results to a channel.
- Added support for optional  arguments for the `Wait` function.
- Added the `Type` function to the `Cursor`, by default this value will be "Cursor" unless using a changefeed.
- Changed the `IndexesOf` function to `OffsetsOf` .
- Changed driver to use the v0.4 protocol (used to use v0.3).
- Fixed geometry tests not properly checking the expected results.
- Fixed bug causing nil pointer panics when using an `Unmarshaler`
- Fixed dropped millisecond precision if given value is too old

## v0.6.3 - 2015-03-04
### Added
- Add `IdentifierFormat` optarg to `TableOpts` (#158)

### Fixed
- Fix struct alignment for ARM and x86-32 builds (#153)
- Fix sprintf format for geometry error message (#157)
- Fix duplicate if block (#159)
- Fix incorrect assertion in decoder tests

## v0.6.2 - 2015-02-15

- Fixed `writeQuery` being too small when sending large queries

## v0.6.1 - 2015-02-13

- Reduce GC by using buffers when reading and writing
- Fixed encoding `time.Time` ignoring millseconds
- Fixed pointers in structs that implement the `Marshaler`/`Unmarshaler` interfaces being ignored

## v0.6.0 - 2015-01-01

There are some major changes to the driver with this release that are not related to the RethinkDB v1.16 release. Please have a read through them:
- Improvements to result decoding by caching reflection calls.
- Finished implementing the `Marshaler`/`Unmarshaler` interfaces
- Connection pool overhauled. There were a couple of issues with connections in the previous releases so this release replaces the `fatih/pool` package with a connection pool based on the `database/sql` connection pool.
- Another change is the removal of the prefetching mechanism as the connection+cursor logic was becoming quite complex and causing bugs, hopefully this will be added back in the near future but for now I am focusing my efforts on ensuring the driver is as stable as possible #130 #137
- Due to the above change the API for connecting has changed slightly (The API is now closer to the `database/sql` API. `ConnectOpts` changes:
  - `MaxActive` renamed to `MaxOpen`
  - `IdleTimeout` renamed to `Timeout`
- `Cursor`s are now only closed automatically when calling either `All` or `One`
- `Exec` now takes `ExecOpts` instead of `RunOpts`. The only difference is that `Exec` has the `NoReply` field

With that out the way here are the v1.16 changes:

- Added `Range` which generates all numbers from a given range
- Added an optional squash argument to the changes command, which lets the server combine multiple changes to the same document (defaults to true)
- Added new admin functions (`Config`, `Rebalance`, `Reconfigure`, `Status`, `Wait`)
- Added support for `SUCCESS_ATOM_FEED`
- Added `MinIndex` + `MaxInde`x functions
- Added `ToJSON` function
- Updated `WriteResponse` type

Since this release has a lot of changes and although I have tested these changes sometimes things fall through the gaps. If you discover any bugs please let me know and I will try to fix them as soon as possible.

- Changed Exec to no longer use NoReply. It now waits for the server to respond.

## v0.3.0 - 2014-06-26

- Replaced `ResultRows`/`ResultRow` with `Cursor`, `Cursor` has the `Next`, `All` and `One` methods which stores the relevant value in the value pointed at by result. For more information check the examples.
- Changed the time constants (Days and Months) to package globals instead of functions
- Added the `Args` term and changed the arguments for many terms to `args ...interface{}` to allow argument splicing

## v0.2.0 - 2014-04-13

* Changed `Connect` to use `ConnectOpts` instead of `map[string]interface{}`
* Migrated to new `Group`/`Ungroup` functions, these replace `GroupedMapReduce` and `GroupBy`
* Added new aggregators
* Removed base parameter for `Reduce`
* Added `Object` function
* Added `Upcase`, `Downcase` and `Split` string functions
* Added `GROUPED_DATA` pseudotype
* Fixed query printing

## v0.1.0 - 2013-11-27

* Added noreply writes
* Added the new terms `index_status`, `index_wait` and `sync`
* Added the profile flag to the run functions
* Optional arguments are now structs instead of key, pair strings. Almost all of the struct fields are of type interface{} as they can have terms inside them. For example: `r.TableCreateOpts{ PrimaryKey: r.Expr("index") }`
* Returned arrays are now properly loaded into ResultRows. In the past when running `r.Expr([]interface{}{1,2,3})` would require you to use `RunRow` followed by `Scan`. You can now use `Run` followed by `ScanAll`
