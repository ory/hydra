# [0.0.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.3.0...v0.0.0) (2025-02-11)


### Features

* Revoke token chain by consent challenge ID ([#3932](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3932)) ([4a40193](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4a40193f246dd4e8e72f45e4fa31d2ee7282acec)):

    This change adds the ability to revoke token chains by "consent
    challenge ID".
    
    ## "Consent sessions"
    
    Each time the user goes through a `GET
    /oauth2/auth?response_type=code&...` auth code flow, we persist a new
    "consent session" to the database.
    
    This is independent of whether the user has previously logged in and/or
    granted consent, or whether the user was actively asked to grant consent
    by the consent app. A successful journey through the auth code flow
    results in a new "consent session".
    
    This consent session is uniquely identified by its "consent challenge
    ID". This ID is obtained from the [`GET
    /admin/oauth2/auth/requests/consent?consent_challenge=...`](https://www.ory.sh/docs/reference/api#tag/oAuth2/operation/getOAuth2ConsentRequest)
    API. Note that it is not the same as the `consent_challenge=...` query
    parameter!
    
    Any access and refresh tokens obtained from a token exchange following
    that particular user journey are bound to that consent session.
    
    We call the totality of all refresh+access tokens derived from a
    particular consent session a "token chain".
    
    ## Token revocation
    
    Revoking an access token (AT) is simple: send the AT to `/oauth2/revoke`
    and it is revoked. If this AT was derived from a refresh token (RT), the
    parent RT is not revoked.
    
    Revoking a refresh token (RT) also revokes associated access tokens.
    
    ## Revocation by consent challenge ID
    
    During an authorization code flow, save the consent challenge ID into
    the access token session data:
    
    ```
    GET /admin/oauth2/auth/requests/consent?consent_challenge=abcdef
    ```
    Response:
    ```
    {
      "acr": ...,
      "challenge": "G_TIM3XABG14UwIgDoT1DRfipjhC1uix" # <- this is the ID we need
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    Accept the consent request:
    ```
    PUT /admin/oauth2/auth/requests/consent/accept?consent_challenge=abcdef
    {
      "remember": true,
      "remember_for": 3600,
      "session": {
        "access_token": {
          "ccid": "G_TIM3XABG14UwIgDoT1DRfipjhC1uix"
        }
      },
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    To revoke the token chain associated with this consent challenge ID, use
    
    ```
    POST admin/oauth2/auth/sessions/consent?consent_challenge_id=G_TIM3XABG14UwIgDoT1DRfipjhC1uix
    ```



# [2.3.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0) (2025-01-17)

We’re thrilled to announce the release of **Ory Hydra 2.3.0**! This version comes packed with **graceful token refresh**, performance improvements, and fixes that enhance stability, reduce database load, and streamline the developer experience. We strongly recommend upgrading to take advantage of these enhancements and ensure the best possible OAuth2 and OpenID Connect experience with Ory Hydra. Thank you to everyone who contributed!

Ory Hydra now supports graceful refresh token rotation, making OAuth2 and OpenID Connect refresh flows significantly more resilient in scenarios such as Single Page Apps and IoT. Even in highly distributed or concurrent environments, Hydra gracefully handles token refreshes reliably, ensuring tokens are not dropped or double-used.

PRs: [#3860](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3860), [#3895](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3895)

Previously, the `redirect_uri` was not required when performing flows with `scope=openid`. This release enforces the requirement to comply with the OpenID Connect standard.

PR: [#3900](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3900)

Hydra now supports explicit SQL migration commands **`migrate sql up|down|status`** that streamline database schema management and help with zero-downtime upgrades.

PR: [#3894](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3894)

- **Access token strategy & advanced CLI improvements**
The CLI introduces new parameters and an option to specify a custom client ID on creation, making it easier to manage and script Hydra deployments.
PRs: [#3718](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3718), [#3725](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3725), [#3874](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3874)
- **Built-in login & consent UI for `hydra perform authorization-code`**
A minimal built-in UI for login and consent can be enabled when testing with the CLI, removing the need to spin up a separate service.
PR: [#3845](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3845)

Unused indices have been removed, down migration scripts renamed for consistency, and all migrations are more efficient overall.

PRs: [#3859](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3859), [#3911](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3911)

- **Improve persistence logic** – Database transactions and concurrency have been improved across the authorization and token handlers.
PRs: [#3756](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3756), [#3763](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3763), [#3886](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3886)
- **Support for more claims in password grant** – You can now include additional claims in the password grant flow, providing extra flexibility in advanced scenarios. Only available with an Ory Enterprise License.
PR: [#3864](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3864)

- **Transaction Wrappers**
Authorization and token issuance are now wrapped more consistently to prevent partial writes and race conditions.
PRs: [#3730](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3730), [#3763](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3763)
- **Improved Docker setup**
Docker configurations have been refined, removing inconsistencies in the Compose setup and enabling a fully static binary build.
PRs: [#3826](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3826), [#3924](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3924)
- **Proper JSON round-tripping**
Fixed an issue causing custom claims to break if they were nested or unexpectedly typed. JSON round-trips are now correct.
PR: [#3819](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3819)
- **Speed up public key retrieval**
Reduced overhead for the JWK public endpoint, solving CPU contention issues in large-scale deployments.
PRs: [#3787](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3787), [#3870](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3870)
- **Fix Docker Compose references**
The CLI now properly references `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`, ensuring compatibility with modern Docker setups.
PR: [#3815](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3815)

- **Dependency upgrades**
Bumped `fosite`, `ory/x`, `pgx/v5`, and various third-party libraries for improved stability and performance.
- **Updated docs**
Updated examples, improved JWK documentation, added notes on Docker Compose usage, and refined OpenID Connect discovery docs.
- **More tracing context**
Tracing calls have been consistently standardized with `otelx.End()`, and additional context ensures better observability.
- **Code generation & housekeeping**
Various housekeeping tasks: pinned GHA versions, fixed minor comment typos, updated newsletters/links, and more.

To upgrade to 2.3.0, follow the usual steps:

1. **Back up your database** (always recommended).
2. **Update your Hydra version** in your Docker configuration, binary, or build to `v2.3.0`.
3. **Run `hydra migrate sql up`** (if using the new commands) or your usual migration procedure.
4. **Restart your services** and confirm that Hydra is up and running.

Check the [migration docs](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/self-hosted/upgrade) for detailed information.

**Full Changelog**: [v2.2.0...v2.3.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0)

*Happy building with Ory Hydra!*



## Breaking Changes

Going forward, OAuth2 Clients requesting an OpenID Connect flow **must** include the `redirect_uri` parameter or the request will be rejected.

Deleting consents no longer returns 404 in certain edge cases but instead always 204.



### Bug Fixes

* Advertise support for response_mode=form_post in OIDC discovery document ([#3861](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3861)) ([9cc5f28](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/9cc5f28825bb80398a9830d4fcb220147f74504c))
* Broken JSON round-tripping for custom claims ([b36b701](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b36b701026d7d7324b0b04529f134d3ed1eb9eb7)):

    Adding custom claims with numerical types (think JavaScript Number) previously did not
    round-trip through Hydra correctly. For example, passing UNIX timestamps in custom claims
    would end up as floating points in exponential notation in the final token. That, in turn,
    confused or broke downstream consumers of the token, including Kratos.
    
    Ref https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose/issues/144

* Change comment on revokeOAuth2LoginSessions ([#3853](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3853)) ([6d829dd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6d829ddb251f9e9f1a49a91438c1bd684e827021))
* Change index name in down migration ([#3911](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3911)) ([3a09db2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/3a09db2abb978df91d875333b1eca70014cdcd10))
* Correct span names ([554238b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/554238b6da4e1d8ad690b1bf359e532382571884))
* Correctly pass multiple token audiences and prompt parameters when performing the authorization code flow from the CLI ([#3736](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3736)) ([632faef](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/632faef15228c2d0a2caedfc3d7c6a3782c2e131))
* Cpu contention when reading JWKs and suppress generating duplicate JWKs ([#3870](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3870)) ([d5f65c5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d5f65c570a02a999867f323630d2a5d099526054)):

    Previously each concurrent caller would need to lock a shared mutex when reading or writing a given JWK set.
    The read path now doesn't require locking a mutex at all and instead returns valid query results directly.
    
    The write path is now protected by a concurrency control mechanism (using x/sync/singleflight) to ensure only one JWK set is generated and persisted.
    
    Note: Duplicate JWK sets may still be improperly generated if running more than one Hydra instance in a high traffic environment.

* Do not iteratively delete records ([#3766](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3766)) ([5ef20a2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5ef20a2a2bc91ccde79517667ae4bf4a36c833ba)):

    Resolves performance issues on some databases when deleting consent.

* Do not retry sending responses ([#3764](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3764)) ([1bbfdb5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1bbfdb56e55525c5bc0526726fa901cf10af59e4))
* **docs:** Adjust note about SDK support on oauth2 flow endpoints ([#3812](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3812)) ([d0e047c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d0e047ccc822972cf44ae6ec35c8f6e8507fe3ae))
* Error log when RP responds with status code 204 ([#3731](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3731)) ([153e4b5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/153e4b56e6de645ee44e4e7833c32a3890e43c54))
* Faster GetPublicKeys ([#3787](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3787)) ([04c34aa](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/04c34aaf2e3c523f4658910d570de80de328d138)):

    GetPublicKeys used to fetch all keys in a set, even if they were actually not being used. This patch fixes that.
    
    

* Improve docker set up ([#3924](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3924)) ([8ca6cbd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8ca6cbd1ab4fe659a0a9feff82766961de6c1d77)), closes [#3914](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3914) [#3683](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3683):

    Improves the docker set up and removes some unused files.

* Incorrect context passthru ([fa50e3e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/fa50e3e999ef962fb522dfa2f9a1f6ffa20848bf))
* Incorrect indices ([#3778](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3778)) ([cb0004b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/cb0004b67b2818b3bca397e98c1bb5bcbb62296f))
* Limit HTTP response size ([2559819](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/25598191ee862b764ff160755b79fab0e95e5136))
* Omit explicit transaction in ConfirmLoginSession and add tracing ([#3886](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3886)) ([a5b2d75](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a5b2d75d4eeab6f26561f7a63cec24ccc7ed1127))
* Pass context to database ping ([fa21711](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/fa217119494e56b043810cd5ba8e8e230a24ea94))
* Require `redirect_uri` in openid requests ([#3900](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3900)) ([5caa629](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5caa6293b155a0ebe069d64d7db056ae8e5aa4b0)):

    Resolves a deviation from the OpenID Connect spec, where the `redirect_uri` was not required when performing flows with `scope=openid`.

* Untyped int build issues on 32bit architectures ([#3885](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3885)) ([68aa167](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/68aa16725f529136d3f7d0282158ff8c9b11bd22))
* Upgrade fosite and improve webhook integration ([#3727](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3727)) ([89323e2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/89323e24de470c2b0f3037e0cf8f99bc4373d4fd))
* Use docker compose rather than docker-compose ([#3815](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3815)) ([ffdfb73](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ffdfb7362a8de6f6f0608879bf034602f01ea250))
* Wrap authorize response in transaction ([#3763](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3763)) ([5b106aa](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5b106aadb0e71add56e3cc68e5a9e33cdb81dd39))
* Wrap token handler in transaction ([#3730](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3730)) ([67a85cc](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/67a85cc799b5c6ef278db93aba131e695fd761e9))

* Add expiry and requested times to logout table ([#3837](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3837)) ([f83193f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f83193f90814691d10d88493eb6357cf37565115))
* Add id parameter to create oauth2-client cli ([#3725](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3725)) ([b372fd2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b372fd20169156efd7c34710f823e0c5b5dbf183)):

    Fixes https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3724

* Add Inspect option to registry ([2013450](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/2013450a9a55af26523554c3aa01fc5243573f2c))
* Add migrate sql up|down|status ([#3894](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3894)) ([d27882f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d27882faf16cd8997c15d8facc1c190dff620a8e)):

    Going forward, please use the following commands
    
    ```
    hydra migrate sql up ...
    hydra migrate sql status ...
    ```
    
    instead of the previous, now deprecated
    
    ```
    hydra migrate sql ...
    hydra migrate status ...
    ```
    
    commands.
    
    See https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/7350

* Built-in login/consent UI for `hydra perform authorization-code` ([#3845](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3845)) ([7f8bd90](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/7f8bd90c2ccbf8be553d526890459f85940c8e99))
* Graceful refresh token rotation ([#3860](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3860)) ([e278b40](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/e278b405e53f6e00f3012a49f14938443d6e7882)), closes [#1831](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1831) [#3770](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3770):

    This patch adds a configuration flag which enables graceful refresh token rotation. Previously, refresh tokens could only be used once. On reuse, all tokens of that chain would be revoked.
    
    This is particularly challenging in environments, where it's difficult to make guarantees on synchronization. This could lead to refresh tokens being sent twice due to some parallel execution.
    
    To resolve this, refresh tokens can now be graceful by changing `oauth2.grant.refresh_token.grace_period=10s` (example value). During this time, a refresh token can be used multiple times to generate new refresh, ID, and access tokens.
    
    All tokens will correctly be invalidated, when the refresh token is re-used after the grace period expires, or when the delete consent endpoint is used.

* Handle concurrent refreshes and improve graceful refreshing ([#3895](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3895)) ([0a6c966](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/0a6c96620674e880cfbff2e077f7faf12ca0e446)):

    This patch improves Ory Hydra's ability to deal with refresh flows which, for example, concurrently refresh the same token. Furthermore, graceful token refresh has been improved to handle a variety of edge cases and scenarios.
    
    Additionally, serializability errors in CockroachDB are now correctly retried.
    
    See https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/7311
    Closes https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3895

* Improve persistence logic ([#3756](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3756)) ([50301e0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/50301e0022ca64c9d0823544c7b664309620c70e))
* Reduce size of verifiers ([#3857](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3857)) ([0cd00dc](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/0cd00dcb0e1390165ae94631fef3980f5b8df40e))
* Remove unused indices ([#3859](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3859)) ([56fc3da](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/56fc3da6297eab16e2aa65818dd149104557b332))
* Support more claims in password grant ([#3864](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3864)) ([41476ec](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/41476ec06275bc348ed4117e9e0223d04bdebfa5)):

    For the resource owner password grant, the Kratos identity ID is now written to the sub claim, and the username is written to the ext.username claim. Further, token hooks are called for the initial token issuance as well as refresh flows for access tokens issued via the resource owner password grant, allowing users to customize the fields present in the access token (for the jwt strategy) as well as on introspection.

* Update clients from files through the CLI ([#3874](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3874)) ([f777fd1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f777fd1ac1047575624924d9243f6e532af4f538))
* Upgrade to jackc/pgx/v5 ([#3798](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3798)) ([cd7e7ef](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/cd7e7eff910441f40382f7b71b3fbfae26b6641a))

# [2.2.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.2.0-pre.1...v2.2.0) (2024-02-12)

![Ory Hydra 2.2.0](http://ory.sh/images/newsletter/hydra-2.2.0/banner.png)

Ory Hydra, the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server designed for web-scale deployments introduces its most advanced update with version 2.2!

Want to check out Ory Hydra yourself? Try common OAuth2 flows in the [Ory OAuth2 Get Started guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/ory-network-oauth2)!

This version significantly enhances performance, supporting six times more authorization flows than version 2.1, thanks to architectural improvements that minimize database interactions for login and consent processes.

Key improvements include:

- Enhanced integration with Ory Kratos, ensuring seamless synchronization of login and logout states across both services. Users logged out from Ory Hydra will automatically log out from Ory Kratos, enhancing security and user experience.
- The ability to bypass the logout consent screen for specific clients, streamlining the logout process.
- Simplified migration with the new feature to import OAuth2 Client IDs, making the transition to Ory Hydra smoother.
- Support for the OIDC Verifiable Credentials specification, expanding the server's capabilities in identity verification.

Thank all contributors who have made this release available!

### Features

* Add --skip-logout-consent flag to CLI ([#3709](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3709)) ([f502d6e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f502d6e38747986cca2ce42b0854f194e85ed103))
* Add authentication options to hooks ([#3633](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3633)) ([5c8e792](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5c8e7923ed22f6d231ca748bb76e4261a87afb08))
* Add flag to export public keys ([#3684](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3684)) ([62c006b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/62c006b916351e7f74fb00e0006ea112801143d7))
* Add missing index for jwk table ([#3691](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3691)) ([39ee5e1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/39ee5e1f0cfa7fae5c4f9e1663a930cb5b8c2bc9))
* Add prompt=registration ([#3636](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3636)) ([19857d2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/19857d20b1d7d3b918de5388f17076de0660a6be)):

    Ory Hydra now supports a `registration` value for the `prompt` parameter of
    the authorization request. When specifying `prompt=registration`, Ory Hydra
    will redirect the user to the URL found under `urls.registration`
    (instead of `urls.login`).

* Add skip_logout_consent option to clients ([#3705](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3705)) ([2a653e6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/2a653e66803ddb03de02d981dbc8ea57b2ac0936)):

    Adds a special field which disables the logout consent screen when performing OIDC logout.

* Allow injecting extra fosite strategies ([#3646](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3646)) ([88b0b7c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/88b0b7cfdf1a1968bf3a720cb2e6640451e2956b))

    This patch changes the primary key of the `hydra_client` table. We do not expect issues, as that table is probably not overly huge in any deployment. We do however highly recommend to test the migration performance on a staging environment with a similar database setup.

* Remove flow cookie ([#3639](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3639)) ([cde3a30](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/cde3a30a92bc30cf072763503e9780a79ba44e43)):

    This patch removes the flow cookie. All information is already tracked in the request query parameters as part of the {login|consent}_{challenge|verifier}.

* Remove login session cookie during consent flow ([#3667](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3667)) ([5f41949](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5f41949ad209c90d114dc427bd6ccde5e08f05da))
* Support multiple token URLs ([#3676](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3676)) ([95cc273](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/95cc2735ed18374cc01d625c66417e42b600778d))

* Racy random string generation ([#3555](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3555)) ([1b26c4c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1b26c4cb96400b333fe214d2da892fc045bbc69f))

* Restore ability to override auth and token urls for exemplary app ([#3590](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3590)) ([dfb129a](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/dfb129a5b7c8ae01e1c490fce1a127697abc7bee))

* Use correct tracer in middleware ([#3567](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3567)) ([807cbd2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/807cbd209af376b9b2d18c278cc927d1c43e6865))

### Code Generation

* Pin v2.2.0-rc.3 release commit ([ad8a4ba](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ad8a4bab63b352c0b259a97d7b3f23247b0238b1))

### Features

    This adds initial support for issuing verifiable credentials
    as specified in https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-userinfo-vc-1_0.html.
    
    Because the spec is still in draft, public identifiers are
    suffixed with `draft_00`.

* Allow to disable claim mirroring ([#3563](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3563)) ([c72a316](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c72a31641ee79f090a2ac1b64a276be58312b2ee)):

    This PR introduces another config option called `oauth2:mirror_top_level_claims` which may be used to disable the mirroring of custom claims into the `ext` claim of the jwt.
    This new config option is an opt-in. If unused the behavior remains as-is to ensure backwards compatibility.
    
    Example:
    
    ```yaml
    oauth2:
      allowed_top_level_claims:
        - test_claim
      mirror_top_level_claims: false # -> this will prevent test_claim to be mirrored within ext
    ```

    * feat: propagate logout to identity provider
    
    This commit improves the integration between Hydra and Kratos when logging
    out the user.
    
    This adds a new configuration key for configuring a Kratos admin URL.
    Additionally, Kratos can send a session ID when accepting a login request.
    If a session ID was specified and a Kratos admin URL was configured,
    Hydra will disable the corresponding Kratos session through the admin API
    if a frontchannel or backchannel logout was triggered.

# [2.2.0-pre.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.2.0-rc.2...v2.2.0-pre.0) (2023-06-22)

Test release






### Code Generation

* Pin v2.2.0-pre.0 release commit ([116c1e8](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/116c1e89c423eebc333e2a9ff3e582090c5798a5))

### Features

* Add distroless docker image ([#3539](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3539)) ([c1e1a56](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c1e1a569621d88365dceee7372ca49ecd119f939))

# [2.2.0-rc.2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.2.0-rc.1...v2.2.0-rc.2) (2023-06-13)

This release optimizes the performance of authorization code grant flows by minimizing the number of database queries. We acheive this by storing the flow in an AEAD-encoded cookie and AEAD-encoded request parameters for the authentication and consent screens.

BREAKING CHANGE:

* The client that is used as part of the authorization grant flow is stored in the AEAD-encoding. Therefore, running flows will not observe updates to the client after they were started.
* Because the login and consent challenge values now include the AEAD-encoded flow, their size increased to around 1kB for a flow without any metadata (and increases linearly with the amount of metadata). Please adjust your ingress / gateway accordingly.

### Code Generation

* Pin v2.1.0-pre.0 release commit ([61f342c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/61f342c2d9f266774885cf1242db796cb671ecad))

### Documentation

* Update security email ([#3465](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3465)) ([751c8e8](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/751c8e8a2f7393c52cd395e899b8852595f8682a))

### Features

* Add ability to revoke login sessions by SessionID ([#3450](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3450)) ([b42482b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b42482b7260d4e1771d01fc719e8216f5961ce65)), closes [#3448](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3448):

    API `revokeOAuth2LoginSessions` can now revoke a single session by a SessionID (`sid` claim in the id_token) and execute an OpenID Connect Back-channel logout.

* Add session cookie path configuration ([#3475](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3475)) ([af9fa81](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/af9fa81ac0b3a877fe1a67505b6ae54d4ef58c00)), closes [#3473](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3473)
* Add token request hooks for all grant types ([#3427](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3427)) ([9bdf225](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/9bdf225d8f04c0b16dcdc4bbcc2d7bebc7534b4d)), closes [#3244](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3244):

    Added a generic token hook that is called for all grant types and includes `payload` with a single allowed value - `assertion` to cover the `jwt-bearer` grant type customization.
    
    The existing `refresh token hook` is left unchanged and is considered to be deprecated in favor of the new hook logic. The `refresh token hook` will at some point be removed.

* Allow setting access token type in client ([#3446](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3446)) ([a6beed4](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a6beed4659febd0917379d6da1e51d8ef75bc859)):

    The access token type (`jwt` or `opaque`) can now be set in the client configuration. The value set here will overwrite the global value for all flows concerning that client.

* Allow skipping consent for trusted clients ([#3451](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3451)) ([4f65365](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4f65365f14ea28f979ebab7eb9c3396cbb25d619)):

    This adds a new boolean parameter `skip_consent` to the admin APIs of
    the OAuth clients. This parameter will be forwarded to the consent app
    as `client.skip_consent`.
    
    It is up to the consent app to act on this parameter, but the canonical
    implementation accepts the consent on the user's behalf, similar to
    when `skip` is set.

* Extend session lifespan on session refresh ([#3464](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3464)) ([7511436](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/751143644dbc842c5928b1961d2c04d55b76b06b)), closes [#1690](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1690) [#1557](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1557) [#2246](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2246) [#2848](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2848):

    It is now possible to extend session lifespans when accepting login challenges.

* Render complete config schema during CI ([#3433](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3433)) ([ae3e781](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ae3e7811ae2ba031fc4f1569a889d8b4ba0c96fd)):

    * chore: bump ory/x
    
    * chore: script to render the complete config

* Support datadog tracing ([#3431](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3431)) ([3ea014f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/3ea014f98f72b1456909838e8f7c40ceade7b2f6))


# [2.0.3](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.0.2...v2.0.3) (2022-12-08)

Bugfixes for migration and pagination regressions and a new endpoint.





### Bug Fixes

* Add `client_id` and `client_secret` to `revokeOAuth2Token` ([#3373](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3373)) ([93bac07](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/93bac074b3f7bd347c329377bf8c14aed7f43c00))
* Docker build ([48217bd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/48217bd203af9467eae570b2c47c777a6c1e929b))
* Introspect command CLI example ([#3353](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3353)) ([4ee4456](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4ee4456d884ef6925a74c26768537e9a1ca8a9a6))

    This patch includes SQL migrations targeting environments which have not yet migrated to Ory Hydra 2.0. It removes inconsistent records which resolves issues during the migrations process. Please be aware that some users might be affected by this change. They might need to re-authorize certain apps. However, most active records should not be affected by this.
    
    Installations already on Ory Hydra 2.0 will not be affected by this change.

* No longer auto-generate system secret ([c5fe043](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c5fe0433be88dc3cbcd09b8c85c3a90819109681)):

    This patch changes Ory Hydra's behavior to no longer auto-generate a temporary secret when no global secret was set. The APIs now return an error instead.
    
    See https://github.com/ory/network/issues/185

* Prevent multiple redirections to post logout url ([#3366](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3366)) ([50666b9](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/50666b96ef28a019f5dfd9758f50c0023ad4ae05)), closes [#3342](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3342)

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.11.10...v2.0.0) (2022-10-27)

This milestone release impacts most of Ory’s installed base. While we are thrilled to unveil Ory Hydra 2.0, we would strongly suggest reading this document carefully and to the end.

Open Source software is not easy. Besides the community version Ory Hydra 2.0, Ory now provides the Ory OAuth2 & OpenID service on the [Ory Network](https://www.ory.sh) making this release a major event for Ory and the entire Ory Community.

Ory Hydra 2.0 is available now. Install the Ory CLI for the best developer experience.

```shell
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -b . ory
sudo mv ./ory /usr/local/bin/

brew install ory/tap/cli
```

create a new project (you may also use [Docker](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/5min-tutorial))

```
ory create project --name "Ory Hydra 2.0 Example"
project_id="{set to the id from output}"
```

and follow the quick & easy steps below.

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client, and run the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow:

```shell
ory create oauth2-client --project $project_id \
    --name "Client Credentials Demo" \
    --grant-type client_credentials
client_id="{set to client id from output}"
client_secret="{set to client secret from output}"

ory perform client-credentials --client-id=$client_id --client-secret=$client_secret --project $project_id
access_token="{set to access token from output}"

ory introspect token $access_token --project $project_id
```

Try out the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code grant right away!

By accepting permissions `openid` and `offline_access` at the consent screen, Ory refreshes and OpenID Connect ID token,

```shell
ory create oauth2-client --project $project_id \
    --name "Authorize Code with OpenID Connect Demo" \
    --grant-type authorization_code \
    --response-type code \
    --redirect-uri ttp://127.0.0.1:4446/callback
code_client_id="{set to client id from output}"
code_client_secret="{set to client secret from output}"

ory perform authorization-code \
    --project $project_id \
    --client-id $code_client_id \
    --client-secret $code_client_secret
code_access_token="{set to access token from output}"

ory introspect token $code_access_token --project $project_id
```

What's changed in Ory Hydra 2.0?

[OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC8693)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693) is now fully supported, including the JSON Web Token profile!

Ory Identities is now compatible with the Ory OAuth2 Login and Consent Flow. This means, for example, that Ory Kratos can be the login provider for Ory Hydra with a bit of configuration.

The Ory Network enables has this integration as a default.

Ory Hydra 2.0 now natively supports key types such as ES256 for signing ID Tokens and OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens in JWT format.

Additionally, the key naming mechanism was updated to conform with industry best practices.

Ory Hydra 2.0 ships a complete refactoring of the internal database structure, reducing database storage at scale and optimizing query performance.

All primary keys are now UUIDs to avoid hotspots in distributed systems. Please note that as part of this change it is no longer possible to choose the OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Instead, Ory chooses the best-performing ID format for the petabyte scale.

Ory chose to denormalize tables that had a negative performance impact due to excessive JOIN statements.

Using BCrypt as the primary hashing algorithm for OAuth 2.0 Client Secrets creates excessive CPU consumption at scale. OAuth 2.0 Client Secrets are auto-generated in Ory Hydra 2.x, removing the need for excessive hashing costs.

The new PKBDF2 hasher can be fine-tuned to support hashing at scale without a significant threat model impact.

This section only applies in scenarios where Ory Hydra is working in a do-it-yourself fashion e.g. on Docker. An Ory Hydra 2.0 compatible service is already available on the [Ory Network](https://www.ory.sh).

The database schema changed significantly from the previous structure. Please be aware that there might be a period where the database tables will be locked for writes while the upgrade runs.

**A full backup of the database before upgrading is essential!** We recommend trying out the upgrade on a copy of a production database first.

To run the SQL migrations using:

```
hydra migrate sql $DSN
```

Ory Hydra 1.x is a crucial service at Ory. Version 2.0 streamlines the APIs and SDKs to follow Ory API’s semantics and specification.

To better support TB-scale environments, the OAuth2 Client HTTP API's query
parameters for pagination have changed from `limit` and `offset` to `page_token`
and `page_size`. The `page_token` is an opaque string contained in the HTTP
`Link` Header, which expresses the next, previous, first, and last page.

Administrative endpoints now have an `/admin` prefix (e.g. `POST /admin/keys` instead of `POST /keys`). Existing administrative endpoints will redirect to this new prefixed path for backward compatibility.

HTTP endpoint `/oauth2/flush`, used to flush inactive access tokens was deprecated and has been removed. Please use `hydra janitor` instead.

To conform with the Ory V1 SDK, several SDK methods and payloads were renamed. Please check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

The `iss` (issuer) value no longer appends a trailing slash but instead uses the raw value set in the config.

Setting

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
```

has changed

```patch
- "iss": "https://auth.example.com/"
+ "iss": "https://auth.example.com"
```

To set a trailing slash make sure to set it in the config value:

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com/
```

Flags `--dangerous-allow-insecure-redirect-url` and `--dangerous-force-http` have been removed. Use the `--dev` flag instead to denote a development environment with reduced security restrictions.

We now recommend using the [Ory CLI](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/installation) to manage OAuth2 resources. As part of this restructuring, some of the commands were renamed. Here are some examples:

```patch
- hydra client create
+ ory create oauth2-client

- hydra clients list
+ ory list oauth2-clients
```

Additionally, array arguments now use the singular form:

```patch
hydra create client \
- --redirect-uris foo --redirect-uris bar \
+ --redirect-uri foo --redirect-uri bar \
- --grant-types foo --grant-types bar \
+ --grant-type foo --grant-type bar \
- --response-types foo --response-types bar \
+ --response-type foo --response-type bar \
- --allowed-cors-origins foo --allowed-cors-origins bar \
+ --allowed-cors-origin foo --allowed-cors-origin bar \
- --post-logout-callbacks foo --post-logout-callbacks bar \
+ --post-logout-callback foo --post-logout-callback bar
```

To manage resources in a do-it-yourself installation, continue using the `hydra` CLI.

Please check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

Ory Hydra 2.0 ships with support for OpenTelemetry. The previous telemetry solution using OpenTracing format is deprecated with this release.

The `hydra token introspect` command has been renamed to `hydra introspect token` and now supports structured output (JSON, tables, ...).

The `hydra token delete` command has been renamed to `hydra delete access-tokens` and now supports structured output (JSON, tables, ...).

The `hydra token client` command has been renamed to `hydra perform client-credentials` and now supports structured output (JSON, tables, ...).

The `hydra keys create|delete|get|import` commands have changed to follow other Ory project's guidelines, including structured output and improved handling. They are now:

```
hydra create jwks
hydra get jwks
hydra delete jwks
hydra import jwk
```

Please head over to the documentation for more information or use the `--help` CLI flag for each command.

HTTP endpoint `/oauth2/flush`, used to flush inactive access token was deprecated and has been removed. Please use `hydra janitor` instead.

Command `hydra clients import` is now `hydra import client`.

Command `hydra clients update` is now `hydra update client`. Additionally, all flags are now singular:

```patch

+ --post-logout-callback foo --post-logout-callback bar
```

To better support TB-scale environments, the OAuth2 Client HTTP API's query parameters for pagination have changed from `limit` and `offset` to `page_token` and `page_size`. The `page_token` is an opaque string contained in the HTTP `Link` Header, which expresses the next, previous, first, and last page.

Command `hydra clients list` is now `hydra list client`. Please notice that the pagination flags have changed to `--page-token` and `page-size`!

Command `hydra clients delete` is now `hydra delete client`.

Command `hydra clients get` is now `hydra get client`.

Command `hydra clients create` is now `hydra create client`. Additionally, all flags are now singular:

```patch
hydra create client \
- --redirect-uris foo --redirect-uris bar \
+ --redirect-uri foo --redirect-uri bar \
- --grant-types foo --grant-types bar \
+ --grant-type foo --grant-type bar \
- --response-types foo --response-types bar \
+ --response-type foo --response-type bar \
- --allowed-cors-origins foo --allowed-cors-origins bar \
+ --allowed-cors-origin foo --allowed-cors-origin bar \
- --post-logout-callbacks foo --post-logout-callbacks bar \
+ --post-logout-callback foo --post-logout-callback bar
```

This change is backwards compatible, but changes the default hashing algorithm to PBKDF2. To keep using BCrypt for hashing new OAuth2 Client Secrets set the following configuration option in your configuration file:

```
oauth2:
  hashers:
    algorithm: bcrypt
```

To improve security and scalability (in particular sharding), OAuth 2.0 Client IDs can no longer be chosen but are always assigned a random generated UUID V4. OAuth 2.0 Clients created with custom IDs before the v2.0 release will continue working with their legacy Client ID in Ory Hydra v2.x.

Additionally, the `hydra create client` command no longer supports flag `--id` and flag `--callbacks` has been renamed to `--redirect-uris`.

The `iss` (issuer) value no longer appends a trailing slash but instead uses the raw value set in the config.

Setting

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
```

has changed

```patch
-  "iss": "https://auth.example.com/"
+  "iss": "https://auth.example.com"
```

To set a trailing slash make sure to set it in the config value:

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com/
```

SDK object `PatchDocument` was renamed to `JsonPatchDocument`.

TLS is no longer enabled by default. We want to make deployments behind TLS termination easier. To expose Ory Hydra directly to the public internet, configure keys `serve.<public|admin>.tls`.

JSON Web Keys are no longer prefixed with `public` or `private`. This affects keys generated in Ory Hydra after upgrading to this patch. Existing keys are unaffected by this.

OAuth2 errors can no longer be returned in the legacy error format. Essentially, fields `error_hint`, `error_debug` have been removed. Option `oauth2.include_legacy_error_fields` has been removed.

The HS512 and HS256 JSON Web Key generators has been removed. It is now only possible to generate asymmetric keys in Ory Hydra. It will still be possible to save HS512 or HS256 keys.

if using MySQL, hydra_jwk/kid and hydra_oauth2_trusted_jwt_bearer_issuer/key_id may only contain ascii/utf-8 symbols 0-127

Encode MySQL columns hydra_oauth2_trusted_jwt_bearer_issuer/key_id and hydra_jwk/kid in ascii as
a workaround for the 3072-byte index entry size limit[1].

This patch merges four SQL Tables into a new table, deleting the old tables in the process. The migrations in this patch are expected to be applied offline. Please be aware that *there are no down migrations*, and if something goes wrong, data loss is possible. Always back up your database before applying migrations. For more information, see [Hydra 2.x Migration Guide](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/guides/migrate-v2).

Rows with NULL login_challenge in `hydra_oauth2_consent_request` and corresponding `hydra_oauth2_consent_request_handled` are deleted as a side effect of the merge migration. This is done with the assumption that only a very small number of sessions, issued by pre-1.0 Hydra, will be affected. Please contact us if this assumption doesn't apply or if the deletion adversely affects your deployment.

    The SQL update here would potentially update a lot of rows, which did not need updating. In some DB engines, this would not be an issue, because the redundant writes are ignored. But on PostgreSQL engines, it is another story; here it would actually carry out the writes, leading to a potentially high number of redundant iops when the engine is vaccuming outdated records. With this change, the SQL update will only affect the rows which is not in the desired state already.

* **sdk:** Type nulls ([fe70395](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/fe70395ae58e52a573bfac7385941d4504a1e403))
* Support alternate hashing algorithms for client secrets ([ddba42f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ddba42f49837c48d4ee9bf9203ffa81f3b31757c)), closes [rfc6819#section-5](https://github.com/rfc6819/issues/section-5) [/datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819#section-5](https://github.com//datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819/issues/section-5):

    This patch adds support for hashing client secrets using pbkdf2 instead of bcrypt, which might be a more appropriate algorithm in certain settings. As we assume that most environments fall in this category, we also changed the default to pbkdf2 with 25.000 rounds (roughly 1-3ms per hash on an Apple M1 Max core).
    
    High hash costs are needed when hashing user-chosen passwords, as users often reuse passwords across sites. A high hash cost will make it much harder for the attacker to guess the user-chosen password and try using it on other sites (e.g. Google).
    
    As most client secrets are auto-generated, using high hash costs is not useful. The password (OAuth2 Client Secret) is not user chosen and unlikely to be reused. As such, there is little point in using excessive hash costs to protect users. High hash costs in a system like Ory Hydra will cause high CPU costs from mostly automated traffic (OAuth2 Client interactions). It has also been a point of critizism from some who wish for better RPS on specific endpoints.
    
    Other systems like Keycloak do not [hash client secrets at all](https://groups.google.com/g/keycloak-dev/c/TmsNfnol0_g), referencing more secure authentication mechanisms such as assertion-based client authentication.

### Code Generation

* Pin v1.11.8 release commit ([337ab3e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/337ab3ec2e363292ff93d5e5641a9b0bb87dba0c))

### Documentation

* Update pricing ([c46f780](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c46f780f4d736a325e63d4542ed3dfbe83431ae6))

### Features

* Add hsm key set prefix to support multiple hydra instances on the same hsm partition ([#3066](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3066)) ([90523fd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/90523fd0d31930666bd091efeb9346498d92978e)):

    This pull request adds configuration option `hsm.key_set_prefix` to support multiple Ory Hydra instances to store keys on the same HSM partition. For example if `hsm.key_set_prefix=app1.` then key set `hydra.openid.id-token` would be generated/requested/deleted on HSM with `CKA_LABEL=app1.hydra.openid.id-token`
    
    This will not affect Hydra API in any way. `GET /keys/hydra.openid.id-token` will return key set from HSM with label `app1.hydra.openid.id-token`.

* Add support for trust grants that can issue tokens for any subject ([#3012](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3012)) ([a3c4304](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a3c4304be2d3988843084d871aa5066d36803219)), closes [#2930](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2930):

    Previously, a trust relationship had to be setup for every subject
    before the issuer could sign a JWT token for it. This change will allow

# [1.11.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.10.7...v1.11.0) (2022-01-21)

Happy new year! We are excited to announce to you the next iteration of Ory Hydra: Version 1.11.0!

This version has significant new features contributed by the awesome Open Source Community - you! But not only that:

**Ory Hydra 2.0 is coming!**

While a major version, we intend to keep all APIs with as few breaking changes as possible. The efforts focus on some long-standing issues in the persistence layer. In particular, data growth rate and performance improvements are the focus areass! If you are interested to see what is going on, check out PR [#2796](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/2796)

And Ory Hydra 2.0 will be available as an API in Ory Cloud! If you are interested in Ory Cloud, apply to [Ory Acceleration Program](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1KWJxgKzNQWOjR9r5blC41wextgn) and receive a **one-year free subscription for Ory Cloud's Start-Up plan**. The Start-Up plan comes with convenient features such as custom domains and unlimited identities/tokens!

More on timelines and Ory Hydra 2.0 plans will follow later this year.

If these changes are not exciting enough already, Ory Hydra now supports loading Private and Public Keys from Hardware Security Modules, a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication, and other cryptographic functions. Thank you [@aarmam](https://github.com/aarmam) for this amazing work! For more information, please [read the guide](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/next/guides/hsm-support).

Next up, Ory Hydra now natively supports the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration and OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol which can be enabled (optionally) in the configuration! Thank you [@fjvierap](https://github.com/fjvierap) for your hard work!

We do not stop there, [@Xopek](https://github.com/Xopek) and [@jagobagascon](https://github.com/jagobagascon) added the Support for JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grants (RFC7523) to Ory Hydra! This major improvement allows Ory Hydra to have an even better integration API than before!

For our Apple users and everyone eyeballing ARM64, we now distributed binaries and Docker Images for all platforms and CPU architectures, including Apple M1, Linux ARM (v6, v7, v8, ARM64), and - this is new - FreeBSD!

Lastly, we resolved a bug in the configuration loading which now allows loading complex configuration keys from environment variables without hassle!

**Please notice that this release requires SQL migrations to be applied! As always, please make a backup before applying them!**



## Breaking Changes

To celebrate this change, we cleaned up the ways you install Ory software. There is now one central brew / bash curl repository:

```patch
-brew install ory/hydra/hydra
+brew install ory/tap/hydra

-bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/kratos/master/install.sh)
+bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) hydra
```

Endpoint `PUT /clients` now returns a 404 error when the OAuth2 Client to be updated does not exist. It returned 401 previously. This change requires you to run SQL migrations!

# [1.10.7](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.10.6...v1.10.7) (2021-10-27)

Ory Hydra v1.10.7 ships an exciting new feature that enables the updating of access and ID tokens during a refresh flow via an HTTP webhook. To set it up, use the `oauth2.refresh_token_hook` configuration to set up an HTTP(S) endpoint which receives a POST request when a refresh token is about to be issued!

And even more exciting, we would like to invite you to our first developer conference which is happening tomorrow and the day after (October 28th and 29th, 2021). The event is [digital and tickets are free](https://www.ory.sh/summit21). After short keynotes from Ory's founders Aeneas (hackerman) and Thomas (tacurran), you will learn from fellow community members and contributors about building robust authorization and authentication, best practices for modern cloud infrastructure and many other developer topics! **[Grab your free tickets now!](https://www.ory.sh/summit21)**

Additionally, improvements to tracing, documentation, ID token claims have been merged. Also, Ory Hydra now no longer takes 3 seconds for the CLI to become responsive as we have found a transient dependency that caused slow initialization times:

```
$ time hydra
hydra  1.87s user 1.90s system 620% cpu 0.607 total

$ time ./hydra-v1.10.7
./hydra-patch  0.03s user 0.01s system 8% cpu 0.450 total

$ time ./hydra-v1.10.7
./hydra-patch  0.02s user 0.01s system 104% cpu 0.032 total
```

Please note that the location of our Homebrew tap has changed for Ory Hydra from `ory/ory/hydra` to `ory/tap/hydra`:

```patch
- brew install ory/ory/hydra
+ brew install ory/tap/hydra
```

All homebrew taps will move to this location, including Ory Kratos, Ory Oathkeeper, Ory Keto, and the Ory CLI!



## Breaking Changes

Please note that the location of our Homebrew tap has changed for Ory Hydra from `ory/ory/hydra` to `ory/tap/hydra`:

### Documentation

### Features

* Add owner/name filter to list clients ([#2637](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2637)) ([ea6fdfd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ea6fdfd6318b964280606a83d733e1e01c4a5b30)), closes [#1485](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1485)
* Improve delete queries for janitor command ([#2540](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2540)) ([6ea0bf8](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6ea0bf8f4dc990667c6911c92a1ad644733745be)), closes [#2513](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2513):

    This patch improves delete queries by separating the data extraction from actual delete. Extraction is made with a configurable limit, using the `--limit` CLI flag. Deletes use that list in batch mode with a configurable batch size (`--batch-size` CLI flag). Default value for limit is 100000 records and default value for batch size is 100 records.
    
    To improve performance, `LEFT JOIN` is used to select also login and consent requests which did not result in a complete authentication, i.e. user requested login but timed out or user logged in and timed out at consent. Also, two independent `SELECT`s are used in the extraction of login and consent requests eligible for deletion. This solves a bug in the single `SELECT` causing deletion of consent requests where matching login requests were eligible for deletion and vice versa. With independent `SELECT`s we keep consent requests even if matching login request gets deleted.



# [1.10.3](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.10.2...v1.10.3) (2021-07-14)

Ory Hydra v0.10.3 brings several bug fixes and configuration features, in particular:

1. Adding the `hydra keys import` command;
2. Passing the `client_id` in the logout request;
3. Resolving prometheus cardinality issues;
4. Moving to `go-jose` for JSON Web Keys and JSON Web Tokens;
5. Supporting PKCE discovery in `/.well-known/`;
6. Support for Instana tracing.

For a full list of changes, please check below!

    This is so the check on the `ok` variable is effectual. Prior to this patch the type assertion on the *client.Client was setting the value of `ok`. Due to the fact the type assertion on *client.Client is already checked and on a false value it exits the func, this value will *always* be true.

# [1.10.2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.10.1...v1.10.2) (2021-05-04)

This maintenance release resolves regressions introduce in Ory Hydra v1.10.1. A big change is that Ory Hydra now support PATCH operations for OAuth2 Clients and is able to handle TLS for admin and public endpoints individually.



## Breaking Changes

This patch makes it so that already handled consent/login/logout requests respond with 410 Gone instead of 409 Conflict. Additionally, a URL is included that the user should be redirected to!

Co-authored-by: hackerman <3372410+aeneasr@users.noreply.github.com>

This patch changes how issuer and public URLs are used. Please be aware that going forward, the public URL is used for redirects. Previously, the issuer URL was used. If no public URL is set, the issuer URL will be used as before.



### Bug Fixes

* CookieStore MaxAge value ([#2485](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2485)) ([#2488](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2488)) ([aafc901](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/aafc901eb09cd26e1c11f2204f46fc1d67517b92)):

    CookieStore MaxAge is set to 86400 * 30 by default. This prevents secure cookies retrieval with expiration > 30 days. MaxAge: 0 disables MaxAge check by SecureCookie, thus allowing sessions lasting > 30 days.

### Features

* Add the MaxTagValueLength config for jaeger of tracing ([#2482](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2482)) ([03c96ee](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/03c96ee22d781939a3fe9cf01763da44242a2308)), closes [#2447](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2447)

* Split TLS config into admin and public interfaces ([#2476](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2476)) ([60704d4](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/60704d490c46840ccad966b3d0ef074913285fab)), closes [#1231](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1231) [#1962](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1962):

    Adds the possibility to specify TLS certificates for admin and public endpoints individually. Also improves compatibility for internal networks (e.g. Kubernetes) by removing the need for having TLS termination on admin endpoints. This can be enabled by setting `serve.admin.tls.enabled` to false.



# [1.10.1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.9.2...v1.10.1) (2021-03-25)

We are excited to announce Ory Hydra v1.10.0!

This release adds significant data management improvements. As such, we introduce the new "hydra janitor" command which cleans up stale data and can be run, for example, as a (Kubernetes) CronJob.

The new janitor command is able to clean up invalid and expired access and refresh tokens as well as login and consent requests. This solves issues observed in installations with lots of traffic.

This patch refactors the internal file embed system by migrating to Go 1.16, simplifying and speeding up the build process.

To follow OAuth2 best-practice, refresh tokens will now invalidate the whole access and refresh token chain if reused.





### Bug Fixes

* Add docs/node_modules make target ([b302501](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b302501b60da8263617966201eab5e99c733481e))

    Move from viper to koanf caused env vars without corresponding
    paths in config.schema.json to be ignored. This commit adds
    missing sqa section, so the SQA_OPT_OUT env var has effect again.

    I made a mistake in previous pull request, these socket mode values are in decimal, not octal format. Sorry.

* Pin v1.10.1 release commit ([2287ac5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/2287ac592fc5a06b1bd3e9f54340a67395452b46))

### Documentation

* Faq custom data ([#2334](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2334)) ([471e85d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/471e85d282e1a8fc731bdaaa1c9375d2fb964b87))
* Fix basic examples for the golang SDK ([#2399](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2399)) ([6806865](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/680686512bc1a5261bc5a9034d88a7bef6a4922d))
* Fix subject identifier algorithms to match configuration ([#2400](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2400)) ([dd19b86](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/dd19b86b015decdfda456289cd970c70f45f3270)):

    On https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/reference/configuration/ under 'subject identifiers' the name for defining which subject identifier algorithms are supported it is called "supported_types", not "enabled" as in these pages.

* Improve readme tests section ([#2380](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2380)) ([277afe9](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/277afe9d1a191ad3b2ec21e5197ecc09146def61))
* Quickstart config ([#2328](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2328)) ([f20f645](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f20f645998cadd066a3d027ceb78002b340442b9))
* Update config.schema.json default values ([#2348](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2348)) ([8494822](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/849482209b6f270dfd7965a1f3d6de39feb3cd58)):

    Updated wrong config schema values

* Update examples to new helm install command format ([#2369](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2369)) ([f006556](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f006556f584a63009af5117c449a52d11aa72a14)):

    Tried example with helm 3.5.2 and it does not support `--name` flag. So I moved name and repository to first line of commands.


### Features

* Add --no-shutdown flag to "hydra token user" to prevent auto-termination ([#2382](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2382)) ([#2386](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2386)) ([a17d10e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a17d10e7c273069e9cac18a9ea0326200bc2b569))
* Add front/backchannel logout params to client cli ([#2387](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2387)) ([055f801](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/055f801eb76e187b3fa70e6a474d68a0d56f766b)), closes [#1487](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1487)
* Flush inactive/expired login and consent requests ([#2381](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2381)) ([f039ebb](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f039ebbdf315715deb44fc20fb3fdef3f4fa7b51)), closes [#1574](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1574):

    This patch resolves various table growth issues caused by expired/inactive login and consent flows never being purged from the database.
    
    You may now use the new `hydra janitor` command to remove access & refresh tokens and login & consent requests which are no longer valid or used. The command follows the `notAfter` safe-guard approach to ensure records needed to be kept are not deleted.
    
    To learn more, please use `hydra help janitor`.
    
    This patch phases out the `/oauth2/flush` endpoint as the janitor is better suited for background tasks, is easier to run in a targeted fashion (e.g. as a singleton job), and does not cause HTTP timeouts.

* Flush refresh tokens for service oauth2/flush ([#2373](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2373)) ([b46a14c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b46a14cd6d260a7dee748de34abfea54908f1a0b)), closes [/github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1574#issuecomment-736684327](https://github.com//github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1574/issues/issuecomment-736684327)
* Move to go 1.16 and static embed files ([6fa591c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6fa591c849c3d63b036d7a4001496f42f02b821b))
* Refresh token reuse detection ([#2383](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2383)) ([bc349f1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/bc349f1fbaf19340081d9a6c097de2b76e848e46)), closes [#2022](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2022):

    This patch adds support for Refresh Token reuse Detection introduced by https://github.com/ory/fosite/pull/567. Ory Hydra's persister no longer deletes refresh tokens when using them, but instead deactivates them - similar to how authorization codes work.


### Tests

* Bump cypress to newer version and add resilience ([c76309c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c76309cf9faba46162af7dc856a99cbccf6403a9))
* Bump ory/x and resolve regressions ([1a03c07](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1a03c0778bc088bb7a7932fb6794fe3707bea4c2))

# [1.9.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.9.0-rc.0...v1.9.0) (2021-01-12)

Today, we are very excited to announce the stable release of ORY Hydra 1.9! This release contains significant internal code refactoring, making ORY Hydra more reliable, lightweight, and even more scalable! Also, for the first time ever, **ORY Hydra handled over 13.3 billion API requests in December 2020** in over **23.000 production environments** around the globe.

Let's talk features - in a TL;DR overview:

- Completely replacing the existing DBAL and switching to gobuffalo/pop.
- Support for SQLite, an embedded database, which can be used for testing and tiny deployments.
- Deprecating the existing configuration system [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) and moving to [knadh/koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf).
- Adding OpenID Connect Conformity Test Suite to the CI, guaranteeing that every code change is fully OpenID Connect compliant.
- Support for the OpenID Connect `response_mode=form_post` Response Mode.
- Compatibility with MITREid, allowing [easy migration from MITREid to ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/next/guides/migrating-from-MITREid).

ORY Kratos implements all the hard things related to users: [login](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-login), [registration](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-registration), [customizable profile fields](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/identity-data-model/), [multi-factor authentication scheduled for v0.6](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/2fa-mfa-multi-factor-authentication), [secure account recovery](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/account-recovery), [email and SMS verification](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation), [profile management](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-settings), [session and device management](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/655), [user administration](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/admin/managing-users-identities), [social sign in and sign up](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2/), and much, much more! Everything works with proven and ORY-hardened protocols in the same lightweight fashion you are used to from our other products. And it natively targets mobile, desktop, web, and robots! [ORY Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is essentially an open-source alternative to Auth0, Okta, and Google Firebase with the added benefit of avoiding the complexity of implementing OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for your first-party apps just to get login to work. So if you are wondering [**whether you really need OAuth2**](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/concepts/before-oauth2), this is worth your time!

To get a feeling for ORY Kratos, check out our exemplary React Native app (available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ory.kratos_self_service_ui_react_native&hl=en&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ory-profile-app/id1536546333)) demonstrating user registration, login, and profile management. It uses APIs from ORY Cloud, which will be publicly announced this year. If you are interested in becoming an early adopter, [get in touch now](mailto:jared@ory.sh)! We have more super exciting stuff planned!

**Changes in-depth**

Let's break down the most significant changes in more detail:

**The configuration system has been reworked**

1. Configuration sourcing works from all sources (file, env, cli flags) with validation against the configuration schema. This makes changing or updating configuration much easier.
2. Configuration reloading is improved and works on Kubernetes.
3. Performance gains remove the need for a cache layer between the configuration system and ORY Hydra.
4. Loading of several config files is now possible using the `--config` flag.
5. Configuration values are now sent to the tracer (e.g. Jaeger) if tracing is enabled.

Please be aware that deprecated configuration flags have been removed with this change. It is also possible that ORY Hydra might complain about an invalid configuration due to a significantly improved validation process.

**The [OpenID Connect Conformity Test Suite](https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite) is now part of the ORY Hydra CI pipeline.**

This means every PR and change will be checked for OpenID Connect Compliance. As part of these tests, we uncovered some regression issues which have since been resolved. Please be aware that fields `error_hint` and `error_debug` will no longer be sent. You can re-enable those legacy fields by setting `oauth2.include_legacy_error_fields` to `true`.

**Supporting `response_mode=form_post`**

Support OpenID Connect flows `response_mode=form_post` was added and has been tested with the OpenID Connect Conformity Test Suite, making it ready for production.

**Compatibility with MITREid**

Adds an option that allows granting the OAuth2 Client's authorized scope when performing a `client_credentials` flow without specifying a scope. This enables compatibility with MITREid and allows [migrating from MITREid to ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/next/guides/migrating-from-MITREid).

**Refactoring the internal DBAL**

We completely refactored the internal database abstraction layer (DBAL). We have been using [gobuffalo/pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop) successfully in [ORY Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) and decided to move the ORY Hydra DBAL to [gobuffalo/pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop) as well. As part of this refactoring, ORY Hydra now supports SQLite for both in-memory as well as on-disk databases, de-duplicating the codebase and allowing for quick and easy persistence in test environments.

# [1.9.0-alpha.3](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.9.0-alpha.2...v1.9.0-alpha.3) (2020-12-08)

We are excited to present the next big step towards ORY Hydra 1.9! In this release we completely refactored the configuration internals and moved from [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) to [knadh/koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf):

1. Configuration sourcing works from all sources (file, env, cli flags) with validation against the configuration schema, greatly improving the developer experience when changing or updating configuration.
2. Configuration reloading has improved significantly and works excellently on Kubernetes.
3. Performance gains that remove the need for a cache layer between the configuration system and ORY Hydra.
4. Loading of several config files using the `--config` flag now possible.
5. Configuration values are now sent to the tracer (e.g. Jaeger) if tracing is enabled.

Please be aware that deprecated configuration flags have finally been removed with this change. It is also possible that ORY Hydra might complain about an invalid configuration due to a significantly improved validation process.

In addition, this release includes the new OpenID Connect Conformity Test Suite as part of the ORY Hydra CI pipeline. This means every PR and change will be checked for OpenID Connect Compliance. As part of these tests, we uncovered some regression issues which have since been resolved. Please be aware that fields `error_hint` and `error_debug` will no longer be sent. You can re-enable those legacy fields by setting `oauth2.include_legacy_error_fields` to `true`.

Furthermore, support for OpenID Connect flows `response_mode=form_post` was added and has been tested with the OpenID Connect Conformity Test Suite, making it ready for production.

Several other bugs have been resolved and we have completely overhauled the tests, deprecating test tables in favor of test suites. This greatly improves the readability of our tests and allows new contributors to more easily understand what is going on!

## Breaking Changes

After battling with [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for several years we finally found a viable alternative with [knadh/koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf). The complete internal configuration infrastructure has changed, with several highlights:

1. Configuration sourcing works from all sources (file, env, cli flags) with validation against the configuration schema, greatly improving developer experience when changing or updating configuration.
2. Configuration reloading has improved significantly and works flawlessly on Kubernetes.
3. Performance increased dramatically, completely removing the need for a cache layer between the configuration system and ORY Hydra.
4. It is now possible to load several config files using the `--config` flag.
5. Configuration values are now sent to the tracer (e.g. Jaeger) if tracing is enabled.

Please be aware that deprecated configuration flags have finally been removed with this change. It is also possible that ORY Hydra might complain about an invalid configuration, because the validation process has improved significantly.

This patch requires running SQL Migrations. Please be aware that a NOT NULL column is being dropped which could require a lot of time when the `authentication_session` table contains a lot of data.

This patch removes `error_hint` and `error_debug` fields from OAuth2 responses. These are now all merged into `error_description` which is according to the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect specification. If you wish to keep the old behavior around, set `oauth2.include_legacy_error_fields` to `true` in your ORY Hydra configuration.

Applying this patch requires running SQL migrations. The SQL migrations will remove a UNIQUE constraint and add new INDEX to several tables which should speed up certain operations. Please be aware that this might cause certain databases to lock which could be problematic if there are many rows affected.

This changes the OAuth2 Token Introspection response to ensure compliance with the OAuth2 Token Introspection specification. Previously, `token_type` would return `access_token` or `refresh_token`. The specification however mandates that `token_type` is always `Bearer`. This patch resolves that issue. The previous behaviour of `token_type` has now been moved to `token_use` which can be `access_token` or `refresh_token`.



### Bug Fixes

* Add encrypt_at_rest option to config schema ([3219c16](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/3219c16d640e4630161a72b2895fc52fac0b1590))
* Add required aud, jti claims to userinfo response ([d0697fa](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d0697fab291e73b2a8f32e655ac4d4127f53b782))
* Add standardized client registration errors ([02a9137](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/02a91370e75485abcc19a4bf8163a6ae9816becd)):

    Adds new errors to fully comply with the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration specification.

* Allow all request object signing algs per default ([edc54c2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/edc54c25eba9a4fde818e9974e2c03fcebe49e2b)):

    This patch resolves an issue where RS256 would be the only allowed request object signing algorithm. The spec however mandates that all algorithms are allowed if the client does not explicitly set the request object signing algorithm.

* Allow lower bcrypt values and add tests ([812a21c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/812a21cf42318d32d57982dbdbf2b1683b808653))
* Document describe error ([#2208](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2208)) ([b59bdf8](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b59bdf8582e61dff6bea72a94874a44744160298))
* Ensure consistent auth_time in session handling ([e973ffe](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/e973ffe04c34520f6f3ea3452bbfd954f307a6e1))
* Increase parallelism to 4 ([ae02706](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ae027064d2afd004b4efc1aaaffff1c693e4eb28))
* Mark false gosec positive ([206d1ee](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/206d1eee8b3a627a0b9111dfd3fee9c73037cdde))
* Nonce is not required for hybrid flows ([c708ada](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c708adadfb0647fa09f7001ef15db1da749ea319))
* Quickstart yml ([5ebd984](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5ebd984f8b6d157fc61269784dc773cc4f772f8e))
* Remove session from store on logout ([4495f56](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4495f56fcd737fb6873cd5891deee062221d20b6)):

    This patch resolves an issue where the session would not be purged from the store when performing an RP-initiated logout request from a client, if said client does not purge the authentication session properly because the client does not have access to it or because the client misbehaves.

* Remove unrelated quickstart entry ([#2214](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2214)) ([a583d78](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a583d78d62f6f959c3271d726bb32612a5da7ec6)), closes [#2213](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2213)
* Request_id should not be unique ([a8ca333](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a8ca333bb65fe591d1795ce5b33760c97ff54d65)):

    This patch resolves an issue where certain OpenID Connect Hybrid flows would error with a UNIQUE violation. The cause of this issue was an incorrect UNIQUE constraint on the `request_id` field of the access, refresh, pkce, and other, similar tables.

* Resolve broken quickstart ([95a1dfb](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/95a1dfb2c06a56235ba1da1c9789f8356382b75c))
* Update deprecated config in quickstart ([1c1433a](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1c1433ab3ae0b3b50a0f911bb4a909cb4ff774fb))
* Update invalid quickstart config ([8d076a5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8d076a5e47c806a3340ffcb48731da14518cd4a9))
* Update package lock ([18bfc96](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/18bfc96fefdf012a31cfc30b376b3ccc65b2cecd))
* Update schema to support new koanf ([29763c8](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/29763c8f938e5e690179c79771ed63684545f8bf))

### Code Generation

    Added Contributing Guidelines to the introduction menu point on the sidebar. 
    I think it should be as obvious as possible. 
    Another good solution would be to add them to the top bar?
    
    If this is merged, I will do the same changes for Kratos/Oathkeeper/Keto.

### Features

* Add ability to override oidc discovery urls ([bb8b982](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/bb8b9824e88249f58a55efe2410d1df357c7f519)):

    Added config options `webfinger.oidc_discovery.token_url`, `webfinger.oidc_discovery.auth_url`, `webfinger.oidc_discovery.jwks_url`.

* Add new `request_object_signing_alg_values_supported` to oidc discovery ([4220959](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4220959c022ae6e8134f9135d65bb40e2d74d843))
* Add oidc conformity tests ([651f424](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/651f4244566f8ebba63bfbe085b5487228e8fe56))
* Add support for ElasticAPM tracing ([#2155](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2155)) ([7792715](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/77927158ee8e90b4b83d829eb2a448885e4d06d9))
* Improve and clean up error handling ([b727367](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b7273676dd79478bf5678046a86f5b5135714559))
* Improve error responses for consent handler ([44ab747](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/44ab7472dc84c01c26e20ea2cb8d95c9a479cf29))
* Improve error stack trace wrapping ([fdf142c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/fdf142cc7c5a195ceca4004d5244fbf89ece7e61))
* Only set state-param if it was passed ([#2183](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2183)) ([568434a](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/568434ac393591d7ba0c2a3ec4eb45be576ffb86)):

    Using `state` in the logout flow is optional, so `state` can be empty. In order to avoid an ugly `/post-logout-redirect-uri?state=` URI, the state should only be appended if it is not empty.

* Remove legacy error fields unless configured to do so ([e2a7135](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/e2a7135fad56d1666ef7910bd98e79a027a00258))

    This patch adds support for the `response_mode` parameter as defined in [OAuth 2.0 Form Post Response Mode](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-form-post-response-mode-1_0.html). Additionally, values `fragment` and `query` are supported as defined in [OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-multiple-response-types-1_0.html).

# [1.9.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.8.5...v1.9.0-alpha.1) (2020-10-20)

This release focuses on a complete refactor of the internal database abstraction layer (DBAL). We have been using [gobuffalo/pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop) successfully in [ORY Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) and decided to move the ORY Hydra DBAL to [gobuffalo/pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop) as well. As part of this refactoring, ORY Hydra now supports SQLite for both in-memory as well as on-disk databases, de-duplicating the codebase and allowing for quick and easy persistence in test environments.

This is an alpha release as we want to gather feedback from the community regarding performance and other potential issues before tagging the v1.9.0 version branch as stable.

# [1.8.5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.8.0-pre.1...v1.8.5) (2020-10-03)

This is a security-focused release with fixes for [CVE-2020-15234](https://github.com/ory/fosite/security/advisories/GHSA-grfp-q2mm-hfp6), [CVE-2020-15223](https://github.com/ory/fosite/security/advisories/GHSA-7mqr-2v3q-v2wm), [CVE-2020-15233](https://github.com/ory/fosite/security/advisories/GHSA-rfq3-w54c-f9q5). Additionally, several system dependencies (e.g. Golang) have been upgraded.

A few things have changed as part of these patches:

- OAuth 2.0 Redirection URL error parameters `error_hint`, `error_debug` have been deprecated and are now part of `error_description`. The parameters are still included for compatibility reasons but will be removed in a future release.
- OAuth 2.0 Error `revocation_client_mismatch` was not standardized and has been removed. Instead, you will now receive `unauthorized_client` with a description explaining why the flow failed.

Additionally, the TypeScript SDK generator has changed from OpenAPI's `typescript-node` to `typescript-axios` making the SDK compatible with both browser as well as node environments, which was not the case previously. Please be aware that some of the SDK's API signatures - especially responses - have changed and check your TypeScript output for instructions on upgrading. You may still use an older version of the SDK as none of ORY Hydra's HTTP APIs have changed.

Due to several complex CI issues and regressions, build versions v1.8.0 - v1.8.4 failed. v1.8.5 the first and only stable release in the current 1.8.x branch.

New features have been added and bugs have been closed. No migrations are required when applying this release. Please check the list below for an in-depth overview.

# [1.7.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0) (2020-08-14)

The new SameSite attribute is now enforced on Google Chrome and may cause issues with your current ORY Hydra deployment:

`SameSite=None` no longer works without `secure` flag cookies. If you are using the `--dangerous-force-http` flag and have not configured `SameSite=Lax` your users will no longer be able to perform OAuth2 flows.

The next FireFox release will follow this implementation as well. To prevent your users from experiencing issues:

- Remove `--dangerous-force-http` from your deployment. This flag should never be set outside of local development machines anyways!
- Set environment variable `SERVE_COOKIES_SAME_SITE_MODE=Lax` or configuration value `serve.cookies.same_site_mode = Lax`.

By applying this release, the above recommendations will be set per default, for example using `Lax` when `--dangerous-force-http` is set.

Many of you reached out in the past asking about managed / SaaS offerings from ORY, for more support, automated updates, and automated fixes for issues like the `SameSite` behavior above. We would like to invite those interested in that kind of an offering and service to engage in a dialogue to better help us understand how you are using ORY, what requirements your businesses have and how we can better help and service you. Together, we can shape some of this journey together. If you like to be part of this conversation please send an email to jared@ory.sh so we can get in touch directly and begin talking about what an ideal and fully supported offering from ORY would look like for you.

This patch additionally includes a breaking API change for the "Revoke Consent Sessions API endpoint" - please check the breaking changes below. Bugfixes are included in this release as well - such as pretty JSON format logging, fixes to Jaeger configuration, and more!



## Breaking Changes

Previously, '/oauth2/auth/sessions/consent?subject=foo@bar.com' would revoke all consent sessions of that user. This may be problematic in cases where the caller forgot to specify the client ID as all tokens for that user are revoked. To prevent that, a "failsave" `all=true` is now required to make this explicit: '/oauth2/auth/sessions/consent?subject=foo@bar.com&all=true'.



### Bug Fixes

* Add json_pretty to possible log.format values ([cc96359](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/cc963595d5bc4e485e3a342777e7bbc48ce6b292))

# [1.6.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.5.2...v1.6.0) (2020-07-20)

We focused on reworking the ORY Hydra documentation in this release.

Even though no breaking changes were introduced with this release, we decided
to bump to the next minor (1.6) version to signal the significance of the
documentation changes.

We also refactored the NodeJS example implementation to use lightweight
TypeScript and the official TypeScript SDK.

# [1.5.2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.5.1...v1.5.2) (2020-06-23)

This release contains mostly minor bug fixes and allows more granular control
for listening on unix sockets.





### Bug Fixes

* Bump pop to v5.2 ([#1922](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1922)) ([5097805](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/50978054737e7ae7c54adf5ec9ee478e9feb174f)), closes [#1892](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1892)

    This install dependencies only when you make a target that needs it.
    
    This also removes the check that certain system dependencies (e.g. go)
    are installed. Instead, we simply let the target fail. This ensures we
    only test for the desired dependencies.


### Code Generation

* Pin v1.5.2 release commit ([4d2cd48](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4d2cd48ee6e43175331febc8463159204b5ae40b))

### Features

* Allow modifying unix socket permissions ([#1915](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1915)) ([b19b7cf](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b19b7cfd2eadf3dc7a1ef904756b435f5205a273)):

    This allows the reverse proxy to actually read the unix socket, since
    
     - The default permissions are 0755
     - Hydra is usually run as a user different than the reverse proxy
     - One needs read and write permissions to connect to the socket
    
    With the commit, one can set the group to be a group that contains the
    reverse proxy user and permissions to 0770

    Issue I experienced today, running Hydra 1.4.10 in dangerous HTTP mode, the CSRF cookie defaulted to SameSite=None, but the cookie was not marked as secure (which makes sense, as Hydra is running over HTTP), so the cookie gets ignored (and was getting CSRF value not present errors).

    Implements the workaround from https://web.dev/samesite-cookie-recipes/ for the CSRF cookies only when using SameSite=None. This is configurable and disabled by default.
    
    Also adds some unit tests for the existing CSRF cookie helpers, along with unit tests for this change.



# [1.4.7](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.4.6...v1.4.7) (2020-04-24)

This is the first release to use our new CI/CD pipeline
which includes auto-generated release announcements
via the newsletter.

If you have feedback on this new process feel free
to start a discussion on Slack!

This release fixes some bugs and improves the docs.





### Bug Fixes

* Allow -1 as ttl.refresh_token value ([#1819](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1819)) ([66f5d3a](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/66f5d3a25fa3efb5484f279844fa6a8245e6b519)), closes [#1811](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1811):

    Because viper converts the type from both string and number to time.Duration we can allow both types.

* **docker:** Add nsswitch.conf into the dockerfiles ([#1816](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1816)) ([48cf366](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/48cf366b9f929f6bd22757864dbd169780dec533)):

    Go's netgo implementation currently does not respect hostname overrides
    defined in /etc/hosts if the /etc/nsswitch.conf does not exists.
    
    Made changes to the Dockerfiles to add a standard /etc/nsswitch.conf
    to fix this issue.

* **docker:** Bump version to 1.4.6 ([0692869](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/0692869a155877d4e0554b9834ca09c3d61110d6))

# [1.4.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.3.2...v1.4.0) (2020-04-02)

Merge pull request from GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66

BREAKING CHANGE: This patch requires a new SQL Table which needs to be created using `hydra migrate sql`. No other breaking changes have been introduced by this patch.

This patch introduces a blacklist for JTIs which prevents a potential replay of `private_key_jwt` JWTs when performing client authorization.

## GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66

### Impact

When using client authentication method "private_key_jwt" [1], OpenId specification says the following about assertion `jti`:

> A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties

Hydra does not seem to check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. Here is me sending the same token request twice, hence with the same `jti` assertion, and getting two access tokens:

```
$ curl --insecure --location --request POST 'https://localhost/_/oauth2/token' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
   --data-urlencode 'client_id=c001d00d-5ecc-beef-ca4e-b00b1e54a111' \
   --data-urlencode 'scope=application openid' \
   --data-urlencode 'client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer' \
   --data-urlencode 'client_assertion=eyJhb [...] jTw'

```

### Severity

We rate the severity as medium because the following reasons make it hard to replay tokens without the patch:

- TLS protects against MITM which makes it difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay attacks
- The expiry time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it could be replayed

### Patches

This will be patched with v1.4.0+oryOS.17

### Workarounds

Two workarounds have been identified:

- Do not allow clients to use `private_key_jwt`
- Use short expiry times for the JWTs

    To improve consistency in certain authorization flows that utilize transactions, this PR forces the SQL storage transaction isolation level to `LevelRepeatableRead`. This will ensure that we avoid the phenomena of non-repeatable reads which occur when a transaction re-reads data it has previously read and then finds out that another transaction has since modified that data and committed. As a result, setting this isolation level fixes a flaw where one could use a given refresh token more than once. See the test added.
    
    In the event that multiple concurrent transactions are competing under a given refresh token workflow, the underlying database engine will eventually return an error when one of the transactions successfully commits. For example, in such a scenario, postgres will rollback the transaction with:
    
    ```
    could not serialize access due to concurrent update (SQLSTATE 40001)
    ```

    This patch introduces environment variable `CORS_ENABLED` which toggles CORS.

* Disable plugin backend through 'noplugin' tag ([#986](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/986)) ([96f4cb3](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/96f4cb3cc11d2befbce453d5c2e0fed3a85fa72a)):

    Debugging Hydra in Go 1.10 and 1.11 (confirmed by one of its members),
    is not possible due to [this unresolved
    bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23733) which is related to the
    use of the plugin functionality.
    
    This change allows passing a build tag which will disable plugin
    implementation and therefore allow to debug in all the use-cases where
    plugin backend is not needed.
    
    

* Enable client specific CORS settings ([#1009](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1009)) ([a36d0af](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a36d0af611582985de5d7e939d059425b1b30d45)), closes [#975](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/975):

    Field `allowed_cors_origins` was added to OAuth 2.0 Clients. It enables
    CORS for the whitelisted URLS for paths which clients interact with,
    such as /oauth2/token.

* Fix serve all cmd in docker files ([#1000](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1000)) ([bba5287](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/bba5287f21d0de235b2b424eb0fe1292bae8af08))

    The MustValidate() function is sometimes called before any other logging
    function has been called and this results in a crash. An easy way to
    reproduce the crash is to change OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRATEGY=jwt in the
    default docker-compose.yml
    
    

* Forward session and login information ([2217103](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/2217103e056d98c384656df2e8dc08fcab8c0b98)), closes [#1003](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1003):

* Adds JWT Access Token strategy ([c932ab4](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c932ab4571f1ae75c526e9b19d5a7c60d533ca41)), closes [#248](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/248):

    This patch adds the (experimental) ability to issue JSON Web Tokens instead of ORY Hydra's opaque access tokens. Please be aware that this feature has had little real-world and unit testing and may not be suitable for production.
    
    Simple integration tests using the JWT strategy have been added to ensure functionality.
    
    To use the new JWT strategy, set environment variable `OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRATEGY` to `jwt`. For example: `export OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRATEGY=jwt`.
    
    Please be aware that we (ORY) do not recommend using the JWT strategy for various reasons. If you can, use the default and recommended "opaque" strategy instead.

* Adds subject_type support to oidc discovery ([78e6552](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/78e65521c2224e24f670771472fd760067b5ce0a)), closes [#950](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/950)

    The `public` flag has been deprecated in favor of setting `token_endpoint_auth_method=none`.

* Deprecate field `id`, now only `client_id` is to be used ([a8b9b02](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a8b9b022d92be09f59046b7eed5867eccef48bd7))

    Asking for a non-existent client results in the following confusing
    error message:
    
    ```
    Command failed because calling "GET http://hydra:4444/clients/no-such-client" resulted in status code "200" but code "404" was expected.
    {"error":"Unable to locate the resource","error_description":"","status_code":404}

* Adds ability to define default client scopes ([215bef3](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/215bef3add6e82793fb84b5c77512330ed4675c1)):

    Environment variable `OIDC_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_DEFAULT_SCOPE` was added in order to better implement the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration protocol. The mentioned protocol does not support the concept of whitelisting OAuth 2.0 Scope on a per-client basis. Therefore, the functionality to define the default OAuth 2.0 Scope has been defined.
    
    Keep in mind that exposing the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration functionality to the public effectively disables the OAuth 2.0 Scope whitelisting functionality, as each caller of that API can define which OAuth 2.0 Scope a client may request.
    
    If you decide to expose that functionality, you should NEVER assume that the granted OAuth 2.0 Scope has any meaning when handling requests at your consent endpoint, or when validating requests with tokens issued by the client_credentials flow.

* Adds ability to revoke consent and login sessions ([8780c03](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8780c035614712471a9064136407e0bc67504394)), closes [#856](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/856)

* Removes policy, warden and groups from this project ([3d0bf0b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/3d0bf0bda5ea2bd73f9fed96e2aa7c1017638555)), closes [#807](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/807):

    We have learned a lot over the last year in terms of how ORY Hydra is being used. Initially, we wanted to avoid the problems facing popular databases like MongoDB or others, which did not include authentication for their management APIs.
    
    For this reason, the Warden API was born and primarily used internally and exposed via HTTP. We learned that access control policies are well received, but also add additional complexity to understanding the software. While we firmly believe that these policies implement best practices for access control in complex systems, we do understand that they add a barrier to getting started with ORY Hydra.
    
    For this reason we are planning on moving the Warden API from this project to ORY Oathkeeper or potentially it's own server. We would add a migration path for existing policy definitions to the new service. The default docker image would combine the services in such a way, that ORY Hydra is protected. We would additionally have an (insecure) docker image without authentication which can be used for testing.
    
    This also opens up the possibility of having more access control mechanisms than access control policies. For example, we can add ACL and RBAC and other mechanisms too.
    
    First I think it makes good sense to move this functionality into a separate service and remove the warden calls internally completely. The reason being that not everyone wants to rely on Hydra's access control. Sometimes it's enough to use a gateway in front and require e.g. an API key for management or whatever. New adopters are always baffled by complexity involved with policies and scopes. Removing that from the core could really help. The user survey has also shown that this stuff is quite complex to grasp.
    
    The idea is to have a separate service which is basically ladon as a HTTP API. I think it makes sense to add some functionality to resolve access tokens so it would basically be very similar to the current warden API - probably even equal. There would definitely be some backup mode where hydra's database tables and migrations are used as to make migration as easy as possible.
    
    Then, we would ship docker images and example set ups where different configurations are shown. One of the configurations would be the current one, so basically what we have now in hydra but with the three services combined in one image.

    This patch makes significant changes to the consent flow. First,
    the consent flow is being renamed to "User Login and Consent Flow"
    and is split into two redirection flows, the "User Login Redirection Flow"
    and the "User Consent Flow".
    
    Conceptually, not a lot has changed but the APIs have been cleaned up
    and the new flow is a huge step towards OpenID Connect Certification.
    
    Besides easier implementation on the (previously known as) consent app,
    this patch introduces a new set of features which lets ORY Hydra
    detect previous logins and previously accepted consent requests. In turn,
    the user does not need to login or consent on every OAuth2 Authorize Code
    Flow.
    
    This patch additionally lays the foundation for revoking tokens per
    user or per user and client.
    
    Awesome.

    Currently, authorization requests fail when a client is being granted scopes that the client is not allowed to request - after consent.
    
    We should add an additional check that makes sure that the client isn't able to request scopes he isn't allowed to request before doing consent.
    
    We should keep the check after consent as well to make sure he wasn't accidentally granted scopes he isn't allowed to request.

    Previously, it was possible to remember an already remembered consent/login request. This patch resolves that.

### Unclassified

* Updates license to 2018 ([fd0f06f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/fd0f06f7e1d468357d253e63449dd3535636e1c4))
* Adds ability to flush old access tokens ([ed0aa28](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ed0aa28c58a122c871da3c7a5bdee32196a662c4)), closes [#738](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/738):

    Previously, no way of removing old access tokens from the database.
    This patch adds a new endpoint (`POST /oauth2/flush`) capable of
    flushing old / stale access tokens.
    
    Additionally, `hydra token flush` was added which is the CLI command
    for flushing tokens using the api.

* Adds newsletter sign up capabilities to CLI commands ([#759](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/759)) ([049f581](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/049f581d5bc126cb355ca95ad39ab3faf9730e10))
* Adds OpenID Connect refresh handler ([#797](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/797)) ([84ddafe](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/84ddafe52cdb85e683558bd036e0935e5b2c693d)), closes [#794](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/794):

    Previously, it was impossible to refresh OpenID Connect ID Tokens. This is now possible as the factory has been added to the oauth2 factory in the host process.

* Adds support for PKCE (IETF RFC7636) ([343e216](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/343e216b6938cde0a8e611b872ffa81f3f92bc60)), closes [#744](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/744):

    This patch adds support for PKCE which is especially useful for
    native mobile apps.
    
    Spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636

* Allows anonymous users access to ./well-known/jwks.json ([f867fd9](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f867fd99268bb3a7ca9f19b7ad58d15659215f85)), closes [#761](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/761):

    The ./well-known/jwks.json endpoint contains important, publicly accessible
    keys for validating signatures such as the OpenID Connect ID Token signature.
    
    Currently, this endpoint shows the public key for validating ID Tokens
    only. As this key is public, a policy was added which allows any user
    (including anonymous ones) to access this specific key.
    
    Thus, administrators no longer need to add a policy to allow access to
    this endpoint on a fresh installation. It is still possible to change
    this behaviour by removing the policy
    ("hydra policies delete default-oidc-id-token-public-policy") or
    replacing it.
    
    This change affects new installations only.

* Correct docker exec wording ([bda2c6c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/bda2c6c28c53d558894d1fd67e81c778b9ca2196)):

    `exec` is an nsenter, not an ssh
    
    

* Forces JWK to have a unique ID ([acd0107](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/acd010726b5fc6367f317ff8b0cad3fbd036747c)), closes [#589](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/589):

    Previously, JSON Web Keys did not have to specify a unique id. JWKs
    generated by ORY Hydra typically only used `public` or `private`
    as KeyID. This patch changes that and appends a unique id if no
    KeyID was given. To be able to separate between public and private key
    pairs in resource name, the public/private convention was kept.
    
    This change targets specifically the OpenID Connect ID Token and HTTP
    TLS keys. The ID Token key was previously "hydra.openid.id-token:public"
    and "hydra.openid.id-token:private" which now changed to something like
    "hydra.openid.id-token:public:9a458aa3-65a0-4982-835f-343eec45183c" and
    "hydra.openid.id-token:private:fa353995-d77d-420a-b967-63bf0721271b"
    with the UUID part being random for every installation.
    
    This change will help greatly with key rotation in the future.

* Forces UTC in consent strategy ([#775](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/775)) ([7c4fd7d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/7c4fd7d1c15a1c38720481be6a4f38fd5f4708e3)), closes [#679](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/679):

    This resolves an issue when different timezones are used between systems
    by enforcing UTC everywhere.

* Generate php sdk and point php autoloader to lib folder ([#736](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/736)) ([f84eb65](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f84eb6586800a1d6497ec7892ca81529300f4c70))
* Improves naming of traits ([85e26a0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/85e26a055b3f3be12bff1743cf16055ad530c450)), closes [#802](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/802)
* Introduces pagination to client management ([#774](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/774)) ([02b3708](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/02b37086fadc2bf8478d433a45c6c4391d9bcf13)), closes [#739](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/739):

    Previously, all clients were returned by `GET /clients`. To mitigate
    DoS attacks against large databases, pagination has been introduced.

* Resolves possible session fixation attack ([1e80a1d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1e80a1d72ecc5db024f77eb91cf70e55ded41a5d)):

    This patch resolves a vulnerability in the consent flow. This vulnerability
    affects versions 0.10.0 ~ 0.11.5 only. Versions < 0.10.0 are not affected.
    
    The vulnerability can be exploited as follows:
    
    1. Malice initiates an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:
      https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...
    2. Hydra redirects malice to the consent app and appends consent
      id "example-id": https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
    3. Malice convinces Bob to open url https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
      and authorize the access request.
    4. The consent app would redirect Bob back to
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id`. However,
      through some means, Malice is able to prevent redirection of Bob's
      user agent.
    5. Malice accesses the original auth code url and appends the consent id:
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id`
    6. As the consent request is granted but not claimed, and because Malice's
      user agent contains the valid CSRF token, Malice receives an authorize
      code that is meant to be issued to Bob.
    7. Malice can now act on Bob's behalf.
    
    For this attack to work, the following preconditions must be met:
    
    1. Malice must be able to convince Bob to access the forged consent url.
    2. Malice must be able to convince Bob to grant the forged consent request.
    3. Malice must be able to prevent the consent app's redirect after
      successful consent request acceptance.
    4. Malice must be able to perform this attack within the expiry (10 minutes)
      of the consent request.
    
    For these reasons, an exploit for this vulnerability is not likely,
    but possible.
    
    This patch closes the described vulnerability by requiring a
    `consent_csrf` value additional to the `consent` value in the query
    parameters of the authorization url. Without that value, the authorization
    code flow will not be successful. The `consent_csrf` is transmitted out-of-band
    to the consent app and not accessible to Malice. Let's revisit the example
    from above:
    
    1. Malice initiates an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:
      https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...
      - Hydra creates the consent request id and an additional CSRF token
        which is stored in the database and the encrypted cookie. Malice
        is not able to see the CSRF token.
    2. Hydra redirects malice to the consent app and appends consent
      id "example-id": https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
    3. Malice convinces Bob to open url https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
      and authorize the access request.
    4. The consent app would redirect Bob back to
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id&consent_csrf=csrf_token`.
      The redirection URL is only accessible to the consent app and Bob's user agent.
      However, through some means, Malice is able to prevent redirection of Bob's
      user agent.
    5. Malices does not know the value for `consent_csrf`, accessing
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id` without
      setting `consent_csrf` causes the request to fail and the consent to
      be revoked.
    
    This patch does not introduce breaking changes. Upgrading to the version
    which contains this patch does not require any code changes or deployment
    changes.

* Skips parallelization when not using docker ([57d0b12](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/57d0b12b0dfbc9c3f75ff0643d9b373ba1b99951)):

    Previously, databases connected in parallel even when dockertest was
    skipped - typically in CI environments. This caused issues on those
    environments. This patch resolves that.

* Stops creating client when secret is too short  ([#764](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/764)) ([f818f85](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f818f857c2015290df5a6ec34c33e8dbee7caedd)), closes [#725](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/725):

    Previously, clients were created despite an error which said that the secret was too short. This patch changes that and improves error output in the CLI as well for this command.

* Strips client secret from output when client is public ([#765](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/765)) ([439267b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/439267b0e480a888a6e0e0058b24f54f358b1841)), closes [#737](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/737):

    Previously a newly created public client had a secret send with the initial response and this secret was displayed in the CLI.
    
    Now it is clear that there is no secret needed for public clients. It is not displayed in the CLI anymore.

* Updates license headers ([#793](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/793)) ([366ed57](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/366ed57d9c39d7601a40b5545f91361e6a2b9f5a))

    Before newsletter text did not seem to make clear that it is just for security information.

    This release resolves a security issue (reported by [platform.sh](https://www.platform.sh)) related to the fosite storage implementation in this project. Fosite used to pass all of the request body from both authorize and token endpoints to the storage adapters. As some of these values are needed in consecutive requests, the storage adapter of this project chose to drop all of the key/value pairs to the database in plaintext.
    
    This implied that confidential parameters, such as the `client_secret` which can be passed in the request body since fosite version 0.15.0, were stored as key/value pairs in plaintext in the database. While most client secrets are generated programmatically (as opposed to set by the user) and most popular OAuth2 providers choose to store the secret in plaintext for later retrieval, we see it as a considerable security issue nonetheless.
    
    The issue has been resolved by sanitizing the request body and only including those values truly required by their respective handlers. This also implies that typos (eg `client_secet`) won't "leak" to the database.
    
    There are no special upgrade paths required for this version.
    
    This issue does not apply to you if you do not use an SQL backend. If you do upgrade to this version, you need to run `hydra migrate sql path://to.your/database`.
    
    If your users use POST body client authentication, it might
    be a good move to remove old data. There are multiple ways of doing that. **Back up your data before you do this**:
    
    1. **Radical solution:** Drop all rows from tables `hydra_oauth2_refresh`, `hydra_oauth2_access`, `hydra_oauth2_oidc`,
    `hydra_oauth2_code`. This implies that all your users have to re-authorize.
    2. **Sensitive solution:** Replace all values in column `form_data` in tables `hydra_oauth2_refresh`, `hydra_oauth2_access` with
    an empty string. This will keep all authorization sessions alive. Tables `hydra_oauth2_oidc` and `hydra_oauth2_code`
    do not contain sensitive information, unless your users accidentally sent the client_secret to the `/oauth2/auth` endpoint.
    
    We would like to thank [platform.sh](https://www.platform.sh) for sponsoring the development of a patch that resolves this issue.

oauth2: Resolves possible session fixation attack

This patch resolves a vulnerability in the consent flow. This vulnerability
affects versions 0.10.0 ~ 0.11.5 only. Versions < 0.10.0 are not affected.

The vulnerability can be exploited as follows:

1. Malice initiates an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:
  https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...
2. Hydra redirects malice to the consent app and appends consent
  id "example-id": https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
3. Malice convinces Bob to open url https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
  and authorize the access request.
4. The consent app would redirect Bob back to
  `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id`. However,
  through some means, Malice is able to prevent redirection of Bob's
  user agent.
5. Malice accesses the original auth code url and appends the consent id:
  `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id`
6. As the consent request is granted but not claimed, and because Malice's
  user agent contains the valid CSRF token, Malice receives an authorize
  code that is meant to be issued to Bob.
7. Malice can now act on Bob's behalf.

For this attack to work, the following preconditions must be met:

1. Malice must be able to convince Bob to access the forged consent url.
2. Malice must be able to convince Bob to grant the forged consent request.
3. Malice must be able to prevent the consent app's redirect after
  successful consent request acceptance.
4. Malice must be able to perform this attack within the expiry (10 minutes)
  of the consent request.

For these reasons, an exploit for this vulnerability is not likely,
but possible.

This patch closes the described vulnerability by requiring a
`consent_csrf` value additional to the `consent` value in the query
parameters of the authorization url. Without that value, the authorization
code flow will not be successful. The `consent_csrf` is transmitted out-of-band
to the consent app and not accessible to Malice. Let's revisit the example

  The redirection URL is only accessible to the consent app and Bob's user agent.
  However, through some means, Malice is able to prevent redirection of Bob's
  user agent.
5. Malices does not know the value for `consent_csrf`, accessing
  `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id` without
  setting `consent_csrf` causes the request to fail and the consent to
  be revoked.

* Adds ability to flush old access tokens ([ed0aa28](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ed0aa28c58a122c871da3c7a5bdee32196a662c4)), closes [#738](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/738):

    Previously, no way of removing old access tokens from the database.
    This patch adds a new endpoint (`POST /oauth2/flush`) capable of
    flushing old / stale access tokens.
    
    Additionally, `hydra token flush` was added which is the CLI command
    for flushing tokens using the api.

* Adds newsletter sign up capabilities to CLI commands ([#759](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/759)) ([049f581](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/049f581d5bc126cb355ca95ad39ab3faf9730e10))
* Adds OpenID Connect refresh handler ([#797](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/797)) ([84ddafe](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/84ddafe52cdb85e683558bd036e0935e5b2c693d)), closes [#794](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/794):

    Previously, it was impossible to refresh OpenID Connect ID Tokens. This is now possible as the factory has been added to the oauth2 factory in the host process.

* Adds support for PKCE (IETF RFC7636) ([343e216](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/343e216b6938cde0a8e611b872ffa81f3f92bc60)), closes [#744](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/744):

    This patch adds support for PKCE which is especially useful for
    native mobile apps.
    
    Spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636

* Allows anonymous users access to ./well-known/jwks.json ([f867fd9](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f867fd99268bb3a7ca9f19b7ad58d15659215f85)), closes [#761](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/761):

    The ./well-known/jwks.json endpoint contains important, publicly accessible
    keys for validating signatures such as the OpenID Connect ID Token signature.
    
    Currently, this endpoint shows the public key for validating ID Tokens
    only. As this key is public, a policy was added which allows any user
    (including anonymous ones) to access this specific key.
    
    Thus, administrators no longer need to add a policy to allow access to
    this endpoint on a fresh installation. It is still possible to change
    this behaviour by removing the policy
    ("hydra policies delete default-oidc-id-token-public-policy") or
    replacing it.
    
    This change affects new installations only.

* Correct docker exec wording ([bda2c6c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/bda2c6c28c53d558894d1fd67e81c778b9ca2196)):

    `exec` is an nsenter, not an ssh
    
    

* Forces JWK to have a unique ID ([acd0107](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/acd010726b5fc6367f317ff8b0cad3fbd036747c)), closes [#589](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/589):

    Previously, JSON Web Keys did not have to specify a unique id. JWKs
    generated by ORY Hydra typically only used `public` or `private`
    as KeyID. This patch changes that and appends a unique id if no
    KeyID was given. To be able to separate between public and private key
    pairs in resource name, the public/private convention was kept.
    
    This change targets specifically the OpenID Connect ID Token and HTTP
    TLS keys. The ID Token key was previously "hydra.openid.id-token:public"
    and "hydra.openid.id-token:private" which now changed to something like
    "hydra.openid.id-token:public:9a458aa3-65a0-4982-835f-343eec45183c" and
    "hydra.openid.id-token:private:fa353995-d77d-420a-b967-63bf0721271b"
    with the UUID part being random for every installation.
    
    This change will help greatly with key rotation in the future.

* Forces UTC in consent strategy ([#775](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/775)) ([7c4fd7d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/7c4fd7d1c15a1c38720481be6a4f38fd5f4708e3)), closes [#679](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/679):

    This resolves an issue when different timezones are used between systems
    by enforcing UTC everywhere.

* Introduces pagination to client management ([#774](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/774)) ([02b3708](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/02b37086fadc2bf8478d433a45c6c4391d9bcf13)), closes [#739](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/739):

    Previously, all clients were returned by `GET /clients`. To mitigate
    DoS attacks against large databases, pagination has been introduced.

* Persists config file right before starting the server ([7fb51e5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/7fb51e594304a96cdfcb31f02af1d123ad88eb70)):

    Tests would fail because the config file is polled in order to check
    if the server is already started or not. Moving the persist command
    right before starting the server resolves issues with racy tests.

* Remove unused code ([c97e764](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c97e7649e188c042bc978d34b2ab469b39222b43)):

* Resolves possible session fixation attack ([1e80a1d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1e80a1d72ecc5db024f77eb91cf70e55ded41a5d)):

    This patch resolves a vulnerability in the consent flow. This vulnerability
    affects versions 0.10.0 ~ 0.11.5 only. Versions < 0.10.0 are not affected.
    
    The vulnerability can be exploited as follows:
    
    1. Malice initiates an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:
      https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...
    2. Hydra redirects malice to the consent app and appends consent
      id "example-id": https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
    3. Malice convinces Bob to open url https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
      and authorize the access request.
    4. The consent app would redirect Bob back to
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id`. However,
      through some means, Malice is able to prevent redirection of Bob's
      user agent.
    5. Malice accesses the original auth code url and appends the consent id:
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id`
    6. As the consent request is granted but not claimed, and because Malice's
      user agent contains the valid CSRF token, Malice receives an authorize
      code that is meant to be issued to Bob.
    7. Malice can now act on Bob's behalf.
    
    For this attack to work, the following preconditions must be met:
    
    1. Malice must be able to convince Bob to access the forged consent url.
    2. Malice must be able to convince Bob to grant the forged consent request.
    3. Malice must be able to prevent the consent app's redirect after
      successful consent request acceptance.
    4. Malice must be able to perform this attack within the expiry (10 minutes)
      of the consent request.
    
    For these reasons, an exploit for this vulnerability is not likely,
    but possible.
    
    This patch closes the described vulnerability by requiring a
    `consent_csrf` value additional to the `consent` value in the query
    parameters of the authorization url. Without that value, the authorization
    code flow will not be successful. The `consent_csrf` is transmitted out-of-band
    to the consent app and not accessible to Malice. Let's revisit the example
    from above:
    
    1. Malice initiates an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:
      https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...
      - Hydra creates the consent request id and an additional CSRF token
        which is stored in the database and the encrypted cookie. Malice
        is not able to see the CSRF token.
    2. Hydra redirects malice to the consent app and appends consent
      id "example-id": https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
    3. Malice convinces Bob to open url https://consent-app/?consent=example-id
      and authorize the access request.
    4. The consent app would redirect Bob back to
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id&consent_csrf=csrf_token`.
      The redirection URL is only accessible to the consent app and Bob's user agent.
      However, through some means, Malice is able to prevent redirection of Bob's
      user agent.
    5. Malices does not know the value for `consent_csrf`, accessing
      `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id` without
      setting `consent_csrf` causes the request to fail and the consent to
      be revoked.
    
    This patch does not introduce breaking changes. Upgrading to the version
    which contains this patch does not require any code changes or deployment
    changes.

* Skips parallelization when not using docker ([57d0b12](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/57d0b12b0dfbc9c3f75ff0643d9b373ba1b99951)):

    Previously, databases connected in parallel even when dockertest was
    skipped - typically in CI environments. This caused issues on those
    environments. This patch resolves that.

* Stops creating client when secret is too short  ([#764](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/764)) ([f818f85](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f818f857c2015290df5a6ec34c33e8dbee7caedd)), closes [#725](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/725):

    Previously, clients were created despite an error which said that the secret was too short. This patch changes that and improves error output in the CLI as well for this command.

* Strips client secret from output when client is public ([#765](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/765)) ([439267b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/439267b0e480a888a6e0e0058b24f54f358b1841)), closes [#737](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/737):

    Previously a newly created public client had a secret send with the initial response and this secret was displayed in the CLI.
    
    Now it is clear that there is no secret needed for public clients. It is not displayed in the CLI anymore.

* Updates license headers ([#793](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/793)) ([366ed57](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/366ed57d9c39d7601a40b5545f91361e6a2b9f5a))

oauth2: Resolves possible session fixation attack

This patch resolves a vulnerability in the consent flow. This vulnerability
affects versions 0.10.0 ~ 0.11.5 only. Versions < 0.10.0 are not affected.

The vulnerability can be exploited as follows:

1. Malice initiates an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:
  https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...
2. Hydra redirects malice to the consent app and appends consent
  id "example-id": https://consent-app/?consent=example-id

  and authorize the access request.
4. The consent app would redirect Bob back to
  `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id`. However,
  through some means, Malice is able to prevent redirection of Bob's
  user agent.

6. As the consent request is granted but not claimed, and because Malice's
  user agent contains the valid CSRF token, Malice receives an authorize
  code that is meant to be issued to Bob.
7. Malice can now act on Bob's behalf.

For this attack to work, the following preconditions must be met:

1. Malice must be able to convince Bob to access the forged consent url.
2. Malice must be able to convince Bob to grant the forged consent request.
3. Malice must be able to prevent the consent app's redirect after
  successful consent request acceptance.
4. Malice must be able to perform this attack within the expiry (10 minutes)
  of the consent request.

For these reasons, an exploit for this vulnerability is not likely,
but possible.

This patch closes the described vulnerability by requiring a
`consent_csrf` value additional to the `consent` value in the query
parameters of the authorization url. Without that value, the authorization
code flow will not be successful. The `consent_csrf` is transmitted out-of-band
to the consent app and not accessible to Malice. Let's revisit the example

  The redirection URL is only accessible to the consent app and Bob's user agent.

  `https://hydra/oauth2/auth?client=...&consent=example-id` without
  setting `consent_csrf` causes the request to fail and the consent to
  be revoked.

This patch does not introduce breaking changes. Upgrading to the version
which contains this patch does not require any code changes or deployment
changes.
