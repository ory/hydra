# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## v1.3.2 - 2015-02-01

### Fixed
- Fixed race condition in cursor which caused issues when closing a cursor that is in the process of fetching data.

## v1.3.1 - 2015-01-22

### Added
 - Added more documentation and examples for `GetAll`.

### Fixed
- Fixed `RunWrite` not defering its call to `Cursor.Close()`. This could cause issues if an error occurred when decoding the result.
- Fixed panic when calling `Error()` on a GoRethink `rqlError`.

## v1.3.0 - 2016-01-11

### Added
 - Added new error types, the following error types can now be returned: `RQLClientError`, `RQLCompileError`, `RQLDriverCompileError`, `RQLServerCompileError`, `RQLAuthError`, `RQLRuntimeError`, `RQLQueryLogicError`, `RQLNonExistenceError`, `RQLResourceLimitError`, `RQLUserError`, `RQLInternalError`, `RQLTimeoutError`, `RQLAvailabilityError`, `RQLOpFailedError`, `RQLOpIndeterminateError`, `RQLDriverError`, `RQLConnectionError`. Please note that some other errors can be returned.
 - Added `IsConnected` function to `Session`.
 
### Fixed
 - Fixed panic when scanning through results caused by incorrect queue implementation.

## v1.2.0 - 2015-11-19
### Added
 - Added `UUID` term
 - Added `Values` term
 - Added `IncludeInitial` and `ChangefeedQueueSize` to `ChangesOpts`
 - Added `UseJSONNumber` to `ConnectOpts` which changes the way the JSON unmarshal works when deserializing JSON with interface{}, it's preferred to use json.Number instead float64 as it preserves the original precision.
 - Added `HostDecayDuration` to `ConnectOpts` to configure how hosts are selected. For more information see the godoc.

### Changed
 - Timezones from `time.Time` are now stored in the database, before all times were stored as UTC. To convert a go `time.Time` back to UTC you can call  `t.In(time.UTC)`.
 - Improved host selection to use `hailocab/go-hostpool` to select nodes based on recent responses and timings.
 - Changed connection pool to use `fatih/pool` instead of a custom connection pool, this has caused some internal API changes and the behaviour of `MaxIdle` and `MaxOpen` has slightly changed. This change was made mostly to make driver maintenance easier.
     + `MaxIdle` now configures the initial size of the pool, the name of this field will likely change in the future.
     + Not setting `MaxOpen` no longer creates an unbounded connection pool per host but instead creates a pool with a maximum capacity of 2 per host.

### Deprecated
 - Deprecated the option `NodeRefreshInterval` in `ConnectOpts`
 - Deprecated `SetMaxIdleConns` and `SetMaxOpenConns`, these options should now only be set when creating the session.

### Fixed
 - Fixed some type aliases not being correctly encoded when using `Expr`.

## v1.1.4 - 2015-10-02
### Added
 - Added root table terms (`r.TableCreate`, `r.TableList` and `r.TableDrop`)

### Removed
 - Removed `ReadMode` option from `RunOpts` and `ExecOpts` (incorrectly added in v1.1.0)

### Fixed 
 - Fixed `Decode` no longer setting pointer to nil on document not found
 - Fixed panic when `fetchMore` returns an error
 - Fixed deadlock when closing changefeed
 - Fixed stop query incorrectly waiting for response
 - Fixed pointers not to be properly decoded

## v1.1.3 - 2015-09-06

## v0.7.0 - 2015-03-30

This release includes support for RethinkDB 2.0 and connecting to clusters. To connect to a cluster you should use the new `Addresses` field in `ConnectOpts`, for example:

```go
session, err := r.Connect(r.ConnectOpts{
    Addresses: []string{"localhost:28015", "localhost:28016"},
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err.Error())
}
```

Also added was the ability to read from a cursor using a channel, this is especially useful when using changefeeds. For more information see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/dancannon/2865686d163ed78bbc3c)

```go
cursor, err := r.Table("items").Changes()
ch := make(chan map[string]interface{})
cursor.Listen(ch)
```

For more details checkout the [README](https://github.com/dancannon/gorethink/blob/master/README.md) and [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/dancannon/gorethink). As always if you have any further questions send me a message on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/dancannon/gorethink).

- Added the ability to connect to multiple nodes, queries are then distributed between these nodes. If a node stops responding then queries stop being sent to this node.
- Added the `DiscoverHosts` optional argument to `ConnectOpts`, when this value is `true` the driver will listen for new nodes added to the cluster.
- Added the `Addresses` optional argument to `ConnectOpts`, this allows the driver to connect to multiple nodes in a cluster.
- Added the `IncludeStates` optional argument to `Changes`.
- Added `MinVal` and `MaxVal` which represent the smallest and largest possible values.
- Added the `Listen` cursor helper function which publishes database results to a channel.
- Added support for optional  arguments for the `Wait` function.
- Added the `Type` function to the `Cursor`, by default this value will be "Cursor" unless using a changefeed.
- Changed the `IndexesOf` function to `OffsetsOf` .
- Changed driver to use the v0.4 protocol (used to use v0.3).
- Fixed geometry tests not properly checking the expected results.
- Fixed bug causing nil pointer panics when using an `Unmarshaler`
- Fixed dropped millisecond precision if given value is too old

## v0.6.3 - 2015-03-04
### Added
- Add `IdentifierFormat` optarg to `TableOpts` (#158)

### Fixed
- Fix struct alignment for ARM and x86-32 builds (#153)
- Fix sprintf format for geometry error message (#157)
- Fix duplicate if block (#159)
- Fix incorrect assertion in decoder tests

## v0.6.2 - 2015-02-15

- Fixed `writeQuery` being too small when sending large queries

## v0.6.1 - 2015-02-13

- Reduce GC by using buffers when reading and writing
- Fixed encoding `time.Time` ignoring millseconds
- Fixed pointers in structs that implement the `Marshaler`/`Unmarshaler` interfaces being ignored

## v0.6.0 - 2015-01-01

There are some major changes to the driver with this release that are not related to the RethinkDB v1.16 release. Please have a read through them:
- Improvements to result decoding by caching reflection calls.
- Finished implementing the `Marshaler`/`Unmarshaler` interfaces
- Connection pool overhauled. There were a couple of issues with connections in the previous releases so this release replaces the `fatih/pool` package with a connection pool based on the `database/sql` connection pool.
- Another change is the removal of the prefetching mechanism as the connection+cursor logic was becoming quite complex and causing bugs, hopefully this will be added back in the near future but for now I am focusing my efforts on ensuring the driver is as stable as possible #130 #137
- Due to the above change the API for connecting has changed slightly (The API is now closer to the `database/sql` API. `ConnectOpts` changes:
  - `MaxActive` renamed to `MaxOpen`
  - `IdleTimeout` renamed to `Timeout`
- `Cursor`s are now only closed automatically when calling either `All` or `One`
- `Exec` now takes `ExecOpts` instead of `RunOpts`. The only difference is that `Exec` has the `NoReply` field

With that out the way here are the v1.16 changes:

- Added `Range` which generates all numbers from a given range
- Added an optional squash argument to the changes command, which lets the server combine multiple changes to the same document (defaults to true)
- Added new admin functions (`Config`, `Rebalance`, `Reconfigure`, `Status`, `Wait`)
- Added support for `SUCCESS_ATOM_FEED`
- Added `MinIndex` + `MaxInde`x functions
- Added `ToJSON` function
- Updated `WriteResponse` type

Since this release has a lot of changes and although I have tested these changes sometimes things fall through the gaps. If you discover any bugs please let me know and I will try to fix them as soon as possible.

- Changed Exec to no longer use NoReply. It now waits for the server to respond.

## v0.3.0 - 2014-06-26

- Replaced `ResultRows`/`ResultRow` with `Cursor`, `Cursor` has the `Next`, `All` and `One` methods which stores the relevant value in the value pointed at by result. For more information check the examples.
- Changed the time constants (Days and Months) to package globals instead of functions
- Added the `Args` term and changed the arguments for many terms to `args ...interface{}` to allow argument splicing

## v0.2.0 - 2014-04-13

* Changed `Connect` to use `ConnectOpts` instead of `map[string]interface{}`
* Migrated to new `Group`/`Ungroup` functions, these replace `GroupedMapReduce` and `GroupBy`
* Added new aggregators
* Removed base parameter for `Reduce`
* Added `Object` function
* Added `Upcase`, `Downcase` and `Split` string functions
* Added `GROUPED_DATA` pseudotype

## v0.1.0 - 2013-11-27

* Added noreply writes
* Added the new terms `index_status`, `index_wait` and `sync`
* Added the profile flag to the run functions
* Optional arguments are now structs instead of key, pair strings. Almost all of the struct fields are of type interface{} as they can have terms inside them. For example: `r.TableCreateOpts{ PrimaryKey: r.Expr("index") }`
* Returned arrays are now properly loaded into ResultRows. In the past when running `r.Expr([]interface{}{1,2,3})` would require you to use `RunRow` followed by `Scan`. You can now use `Run` followed by `ScanAll`
