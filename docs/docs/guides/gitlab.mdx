Gitlab has several OAuth2 related features. The relevant here is the possibility
to sign into GitLab with (almost) any OAuth2 provider, in this case hydra. The documentation for this
is quite generic and also not very detailed. So, in this guide, we'll connect
gitlab's omniauth-connector to ORY Hydra. We'll do that in a docker-based
lab-environment in order to investigate the details before you do something like
this in production.

## Preparation

Even though we're mostly using hydra in a docker-container, having the
command-line-client available is quite useful. So let's install hydra as
explained in the [installation-guide](../install).
You'll also need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

The [hydra-5-min-tutorial](../5min-tutorial) might
be worth checking out upfront. It'll a give a nice quick overview how OAuth2 is
working within hydra with a minimal example. We assume basic knowledge, here.

If you have not yet the source-code of hydra, which we'll need for the docker-compose
yaml-files, clone this repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ory/hydra-gitlab-example.git
```

## Spin up the instances

Gitlab has some [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/) about
how to use their docker-images. It has also an example for docker-compose. So change into the directory with the Hydra 
source code and create a new file quickstart-gitlab.yml with this content:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  gitlab:
    image: gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
    restart: always
    hostname: gitlab.example.com
    environment:
      GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
        external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com:8000/'
    ports:
      - "443:443" # https
      - "8000:8000" # http
      - "2222:22" # ssh
    volumes:
    - '$GITLAB_HOME/config:/etc/gitlab'
    - '$GITLAB_HOME/logs:/var/log/gitlab'
    - '$GITLAB_HOME/data:/var/opt/gitlab'
```

Now we can spinup the instances.

```shell
export GITLAB_HOME=$(pwd)/gitlab
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml \
    -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f quickstart-gitlab.yml \
    up --build
```

Gitlab will take some time until it's up. You'll see the logs in the output. So you need to open a new terminal for the next steps. 

Make sure to have the Domain-Name
`gitlab.example.com` assigned to `127.0.0.1` before accessing the
[gitlab-frontend](http://gitlab.example.com:8000). On an unixoid system, this is done by adding
a line like this to your `/etc/host/file`:
```
127.0.0.1 gitlab.example.com
```

With the initial login, you will have to change the root-password.

## Modify the gitlab configuration for OAuth2

The gitlab-configuration can be modified in the container like such:

```shell
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml  -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f quickstart-gitlab.yml exec gitlab vim /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
```

Using vim might not be your first choice and if you never used it, it's quite
unintuitive and confusing but it's worth learning the basics to do simple changes like this. Check the basics
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggSyF1SVFr4).

The first configuration is already done by overriding the
[external_url](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#configuring-the-external-url-for-gitlab)
via an environment-variable within the quickstart.yaml. Now, at around line 433,
add this:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['omniauth_enabled'] = true
gitlab_rails['omniauth_block_auto_created_users'] = false
gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
  {
    'name' => 'oauth2_generic',
    'app_id' => 'gitlab',
    'app_secret' => 'theSecret',
    'args' => {
      client_options: {
        'site' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444', # including port if necessary
        'user_info_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/userinfo',
        'authorize_url' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/auth',
        'token_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/oauth2/token'
      },
      user_response_structure: {
      },
      # optionally, you can add the following two lines to "white label" the display name
      # of this strategy (appears in urls and Gitlab login buttons)
      # If you do this, you must also replace oauth2_generic, everywhere it appears above, with the new name.
      name: 'ORY_Hydra', # display name for this strategy
      #strategy_class: "OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2Generic" # Devise-specific config option Gitlab uses to find renamed strategy
    }
  }
]
```

After you did these changes, restart the container:

```shell
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml  -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f quickstart-gitlab.yml up -d --force-recreate
```

While gitlab is restarting, let's look at the changes in detail here, as this is
the main-change on the gitlab-side. First of all, the documentation for this is
quite scattered in gitlab:

- A specific
  [step-by-step guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth2_generic.html)
  but not very detailed
- [OmniAuth reference documenation in gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/omniauth.html#initial-omniauth-configuration)
- [OmniAuth Generic reference documenation in gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth2_generic.html)
- [OmniAuth Gem-documentation from Satorix](https://gitlab.com/satorix/omniauth-oauth2-generic#gitlab-config-example)

The biggest-source for errors is the clients-options-section. Here we'll specify
the details for the OAuth2 flow and where hydra is located. Two things are
extremely important to keep in your mind when looking at configurations which
are specifying some flow one way or another:

- Where is the DNS-name resolved? Sometimes it's on the users browser, sometimes
  on gitlab or on the hydra-side. Especially in our docker-based POC, it makes a
  huge difference!
- Cookies can only be written/read, if they are from the same domain. In that
  case "127.0.0.1". That would be a different domain than "localhost". Pay
  attention to that.

These two points in our mind, let's look at the three configurations:

- `'site' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444'` This is the default for the three URLs
  later if not specified otherwise.
- `'authorize_url' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/auth'` this url will be a
  redirect-target and therefore resolved on the browser of the user. Probably we
  could omit the scheme, host and port as this is already defined in `site`.
- `'token_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/oauth2/token'` the `token_url` will get used
  on the gitlab-server to get a token after gitlab received the grant. As
  it's resolved on the gitlab-side, we're using docker-name of the
  hydra-container which is by default resolvable on the gitlab-container.
- `'user_info_url' => 'http://hydra:4444/userinfo',` same thing for the
  `user_info_url`. It's called on the gitlab-container and needs to be resolvable
  there.

The paths here are by default the same paths which are specified by OpenID
connect. The configuration would be simpler if we used OpenID-Connect (more
about that later in the appendix) but in our case we're simply manually specifying the values.
So it's not an accident that these pathes here are the very same then what you
get from hydra:

```shell script
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:4444/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .
[...]
{
  "issuer": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/",
  "authorization_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/auth",
  "token_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/oauth2/token",
  "jwks_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/.well-known/jwks.json",
[...]
  "userinfo_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:4444/userinfo",
  "scopes_supported": [
    "offline_access",
    "offline",
    "openid"
  ],
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": [
    "client_secret_post",
    "client_secret_basic",
    "private_key_jwt",
    "none"
  ],
  [...]
}
```

Also worth noting here is the supported `token_endpoint_auth_methods`: How does
gitlab authenticate against hydra? So gitlab is using `client_secret_post` which
we'll need to specify when we're creating the gitlab-client in hydra, which we'll do later in this guide.

You should now see a "Ory Hydra" Login-button on the
[sign-in-page](http://localhost:8000/users/sign_in) but if you click it, you'll
get a:

> Error: invalid_client Description: Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown
> client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication
> method) Hint: The requested OAuth 2.0 Client does not exist.

## Creating the GitLab OAuth2 Client in hydra

So depending on whether you've the hydra-binary available, you can use it
directly

```shell
$ hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitlab \
    --secret theSecret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token, email \
    --scope openid,offline_access,profile,email \
    --callbacks http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/ORY_Hydra/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post
```

or you can use the binary within the docker-container:

```shell script
$ docker-compose -f quickstart.yml exec hydra \
    hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitlab \
    --secret theSecret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token,email \
    --scope openid,offline_access,profile,email \
    --callbacks http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/ORY_Hydra/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post
```

Some remarks:

- The endpoint is not part of the configuration but it's a command-line-switch telling the
  hydra-binary to which hydra-instance to talk to
- `id` and `secret` has been specified before in the gitlab-config
- the token-endpoint-auth-method is by default `client_secret_basic` but gitlab
  is using `client_secret_post` (couldn't find that anywhere in the
  gitlab-documentation, though)
- The callback needs to be resolvable on the users-browser. However, orginilly,
  the callback-url is created on the gitlab-side. In order to make that
  resolvable on the client, we set the `external_url` in the
  gitlab-configuration. Here that value is just there to cross-check with the
  generated one. It needs to match exactly.

So after this, clicking the login-button on the
[sign-in-page](http://localhost:8000/users/sign_in) will forward to Ory Hydra,
which will redirect to the consent-app on port 3000. After the login, you'd get
to the granting-page of the consent-app and after you've "allowed access",
you'll get redirected back to gitlab which will unfortunately mention:

> Could not authenticate you from ORYHydra because "The request is missing 
> a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a 
> parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed".

So the message in quotes is from hydra and not very expressive. Note that
it's a bit difficult to expose very meaningful error-messages as this could be
used for security-attacks. Check the hydra-logs what's wrong and you'll find:

```
hydra_1          | time=2020-08-24T12:42:36Z level=error msg=An error occurred

or environment variable "LOG_LEAK_SENSITIVE_VALUES=true".

```

Ok, using http-callback-URLs doesn't make much sense in production however, 
in a POC like this, http makes sense. 
So therefore there is a switch in the hydra-binary which "whitelists"
urls to be used without https. So please add the following switch to the 
services.hydra.command-section in the quickstart.yml:
`--dangerous-allow-insecure-redirect-urls http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/ORY_Hydra/callback`

Restart the hydra-container:
```shell
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml \
    -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f quickstart-gitlab.yml \
    restart hydra
```

Retrying now the login results in:

> Signing in using your Ory Hydra account without a pre-existing GitLab account
> is not allowed. Create a GitLab account first, and then connect it to your Ory
> Hydra account.

## Proper gitlab user-creation

So gitlab is assuming that the user is already existing but it's not. A common solution to this issue
is to create the users on the fly with the first login.
So in order to do that you need to specify this in the `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['omniauth_allow_single_sign_on'] = ['ORY_Hydra']
```

So the creation of the user needs to call to hydra's
[userinfo-endpoint](../reference/api#openid-connect-userinfo).
The most important attribute is the sub-attribute which provides, according to
the [specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken),
the ID of a user which is (in this case) the email-address. However, the email-address
of this one hardcoded user (foo@bar.com) is empty.
As a result, we're still getting an errormessage:

> Sign-in failed because Email can't be blank and Notification email can't be
> blank.

So now let's modify the mapping of fields a bit, in order to fill the
email-field with the content of the sub-field:

```ruby
      user_response_structure: {
        root_path: [],
        id_path: 'sub',
        attributes: {
                email: 'sub'
        }
      },
```

Whether the attribute "email" is there or not is quite critical here. The Login-ID has the form of an email.
So in order to satisfy Gitlab's requirement, we're mapping here the email-attribute to the Login-ID
which is represented by "sub". This shouldn't be necessary in a real-world-implementation.

But assuming that it's not doing that mapping, then gitlab would need to ask hydra on that endpoint 
the email-address. But is gitlab even allowed to read it? We need consent from the user for that and
fortunately we configured the client above to be able to ask for that scope.
However, we also need to configure gitlab to ask for that scope:

```
     authorize_params: {
           scope: 'email'
      },
```

This is the last change and now, the integration should work properly.

## Conclusion

We've successfully integrated GitLab with hydra. Everything was done as configuration.
No code has been created nor has any application been monkey-patched while following this guide (so far).
However, GitLab is supporting OpenID-Connect and hydra does that as well. Why
hasn't that been used in this guide?


## Appendix: Some notes about OpenID connect

OpenID might be the better choice then plain OAuth2. When we tried that, we ran
into the issue that the used OpenID-connect-implemenation does not allow
http-connection but "only" https. That's in general a good thing but stupid for
POCs like this. Whereas hydra has a switch to whitelist URLs in such cases, the
used
[openid-connect-implementation](https://github.com/nov/openid_connect/issues/47)
doesn't seem to have that. So, here is a reasonable openID-Connect
configuration:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
  { 'name' => 'openid_connect',
    'label' => 'ORY Hydra',
    # 'icon' => '<custom_provider_icon>',
    'args' => {
      'name' => 'openid_connect',
      'scope' => ['openid'],
      'response_type' => 'code',
      'issuer' => 'http://127.0.0.1:4444/',
      'discovery' => true,
      'client_auth_method' => 'basic',
      'send_scope_to_token_endpoint' => 'false',
      'client_options' => {
        'identifier' => 'gitlab',
        'secret' => 'theSecret',
        'redirect_uri' => 'http://gitlab.example.com:8000/users/auth/openid_connect/callback'
      }
    }
  }
]
```

In order to make that work which is not ssl, we need to patch the openid_connect
gem. Checkout the details
[here](https://github.com/nov/openid_connect/issues/47).

```shell
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml  -f quickstart-postgres.yml -f quickstart-gitlab.yml exec gitlab /opt/gitlab/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/openid_connect-1.1.8/lib/openid_connect/discovery/provider/config.rb
```

```
          def initialize(uri)
            @host = uri.host
            @port = uri.port unless [80, 443].include?(uri.port)
            @path = File.join uri.path, '.well-known/openid-configuration'
            @scheme = uri.scheme
            attr_missing!
          end

          def endpoint
            case scheme
            when "http"
              SWD.url_builder = URI::HTTP
            else
              SWD.url_builder = URI::HTTPS
            end
            SWD.url_builder.build [nil, host, port, path, nil, nil]
          rescue URI::Error => e
            raise SWD::Exception.new(e.message)
          end
```

In order to avoid that scenario, this guide avoids OpenID-Connect. There might also be other [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/62208) with OpenID-Connect on GitLab.
