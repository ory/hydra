[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/dancannon/gorethink/master.svg "build status")](https://travis-ci.org/dancannon/gorethink) 

[Go](http://golang.org/) driver for [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com/) 

![GoRethink Logo](https://raw.github.com/wiki/dancannon/gorethink/gopher-and-thinker-s.png "Golang Gopher and RethinkDB Thinker")

Current version: v1.3.2 (RethinkDB v2.2)

Please note that this version of the driver only supports versions of RethinkDB using the v0.4 protocol (any versions of the driver older than RethinkDB 2.0 will not work).

## Installation

```sh
go get -u github.com/dancannon/gorethink
```

Or (pinned to the v1.x.x tag)
```
go get gopkg.in/dancannon/gorethink.v1
```

## Connection

### Basic Connection

Setting up a basic connection with RethinkDB is simple:

```go
import (
    r "github.com/dancannon/gorethink"
    "log"
)

var session *r.Session

session, err := r.Connect(r.ConnectOpts{
    Address: "localhost:28015",
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err.Error())
}

```
See the [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/dancannon/gorethink#Connect) for a list of supported arguments to Connect().

### Connection Pool

The driver uses a connection pool at all times, by default it creates and frees connections automatically. It's safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

To configure the connection pool `MaxIdle`, `MaxOpen` and `Timeout` can be specified during connection. If you wish to change the value of `MaxIdle` or `MaxOpen` during runtime then the functions `SetMaxIdleConns` and `SetMaxOpenConns` can be used.

```go
var session *r.Session

session, err := r.Connect(r.ConnectOpts{
    Address: "localhost:28015",
    Database: "test",
    MaxIdle: 10,
    MaxOpen: 10,
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err.Error())
}

session.SetMaxOpenConns(5)
```

### Connect to a cluster

To connect to a RethinkDB cluster which has multiple nodes you can use the following syntax. When connecting to a cluster with multiple nodes queries will be distributed between these nodes.

```go
var session *r.Session

session, err := r.Connect(r.ConnectOpts{
    Addresses: []string{"localhost:28015", "localhost:28016"},
    Database: "test",
    AuthKey:  "14daak1cad13dj",
    DiscoverHosts: true,
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err.Error())
}
```

When `DiscoverHosts` is true any nodes are added to the cluster after the initial connection then the new node will be added to the pool of available nodes used by GoRethink. Unfortunately the canonical address of each server in the cluster **MUST** be set as otherwise clients will try to connect to the database nodes locally. For more information about how to set a RethinkDB servers canonical address set this page http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/config-file/.


## Query Functions

This library is based on the official drivers so the code on the [API](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/) page should require very few changes to work.

To view full documentation for the query functions check the [API reference](https://github.com/dancannon/gorethink/wiki/Go-ReQL-command-reference) or [GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/dancannon/gorethink#Term)

Slice Expr Example
```go
r.Expr([]interface{}{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).Run(session)
```
Map Expr Example
```go
r.Expr(map[string]interface{}{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}).Run(session)
```
Get Example
```go
r.DB("database").Table("table").Get("GUID").Run(session)
```
Map Example (Func)
```go
r.Expr([]interface{}{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).Map(func (row Term) interface{} {
    return row.Add(1)
}).Run(session)
```
Map Example (Implicit)
```go
r.Expr([]interface{}{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).Map(r.Row.Add(1)).Run(session)
```
Between (Optional Args) Example
```go
r.DB("database").Table("table").Between(1, 10, r.BetweenOpts{
    Index: "num",
    RightBound: "closed",
}).Run(session)
```

### Optional Arguments

As shown above in the Between example optional arguments are passed to the function as a struct. Each function that has optional arguments as a related struct. This structs are named in the format FunctionNameOpts, for example BetweenOpts is the related struct for Between.

## Results

Different result types are returned depending on what function is used to execute the query.

- `Run` returns a cursor which can be used to view all rows returned.
- `RunWrite` returns a WriteResponse and should be used for queries such as Insert, Update, etc...
- `Exec` sends a query to the server and closes the connection immediately after reading the response from the database. If you do not wish to wait for the response then you can set the `NoReply` flag.

Example:

```go
res, err := r.DB("database").Table("tablename").Get(key).Run(session)
if err != nil {
    // error
}
defer res.Close() // Always ensure you close the cursor to ensure connections are not leaked
```

Cursors have a number of methods available for accessing the query results

- `Next` retrieves the next document from the result set, blocking if necessary.
- `All` retrieves all documents from the result set into the provided slice.
- `One` retrieves the first document from the result set.

Examples:

```go
var row interface{}
for res.Next(&row) {
    // Do something with row
}
if res.Err() != nil {
    // error
}
```

```go
var rows []interface{}
err := res.All(&rows)
if err != nil {
    // error
}
```

```go
var row interface{}
err := res.One(&row)
if err == r.ErrEmptyResult {
    // row not found
}
if err != nil {
    // error
}
```

## Encoding/Decoding
When passing structs to Expr(And functions that use Expr such as Insert, Update) the structs are encoded into a map before being sent to the server. Each exported field is added to the map unless

  - the field's tag is "-", or
  - the field is empty and its tag specifies the "omitempty" option.

Each fields default name in the map is the field name but can be specified in the struct field's tag value. The "gorethink" key in
the struct field's tag value is the key name, followed by an optional comma
and options. Examples:

```go
// Field is ignored by this package.
Field int `gorethink:"-"`
// Field appears as key "myName".
Field int `gorethink:"myName"`
// Field appears as key "myName" and
// the field is omitted from the object if its value is empty,
// as defined above.
Field int `gorethink:"myName,omitempty"`
// Field appears as key "Field" (the default), but
// the field is skipped if empty.
// Note the leading comma.
Field int `gorethink:",omitempty"`
```

**NOTE:** It is strongly recommended that struct tags are used to explicitly define the mapping between your Go type and how the data is stored by RethinkDB. This is especially important when using an `Id` field as by default RethinkDB will create a field named `id` as the primary key (note that the RethinkDB field is lowercase but the Go version starts with a capital letter).

When encoding maps with non-string keys the key values are automatically converted to strings where possible, however it is recommended that you use strings where possible (for example `map[string]T`).

## Logging

By default the driver logs errors when it fails to connect to the database. If you would like more verbose error logging you can call `r.SetVerbose(true)`.

Alternatively if you wish to modify the logging behaviour you can modify the logger provided by `github.com/Sirupsen/logrus`. For example the following code completely disable the logger:

```go
r.Log.Out = ioutil.Discard
```

## Benchmarks

Everyone wants their project's benchmarks to be speedy. And while we know that rethinkDb and the gorethink driver are quite fast, our primary goal is for our benchmarks to be correct. They are designed to give you, the user, an accurate picture of writes per second (w/s). If you come up with a accurate test that meets this aim, submit a pull request please.
