// Int Int Int Int An Int represents a signed multi-precision integer.
// The zero value for an Int represents the value 0.
//
// Operations always take pointer arguments (*Int) rather
// than Int values, and each unique Int value requires
// its own unique *Int pointer. To "copy" an Int value,
// an existing (or newly allocated) Int must be set to
// a new value using the Int.Set method; shallow copies
// of Ints are not supported and may lead to errors.
