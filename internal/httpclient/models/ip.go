// IP IP An IP is a single IP address, a slice of bytes.

// or 16-byte (IPv6) slices as input.

// Note that in this documentation, referring to an
// IP address as an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address
// is a semantic property of the address, not just the
// length of the byte slice: a 16-byte slice can still
// be an IPv4 address.
